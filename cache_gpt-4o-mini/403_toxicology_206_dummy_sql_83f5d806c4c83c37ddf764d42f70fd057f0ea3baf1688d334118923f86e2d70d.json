"To answer the question \"What elements are in the TR004_8_9 bond atoms?\", we need to identify the atoms associated with the bond_id 'TR004_8_9' and then retrieve their corresponding elements from the atom table.\n\nHere's how we can construct the SQL query:\n\n1. First, we need to find the atoms connected by the bond 'TR004_8_9' from the `connected` table.\n2. Then, we will use the atom IDs obtained from the `connected` table to fetch the elements from the `atom` table.\n\nThe SQL query will look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT a.element\nFROM connected c\nJOIN atom a ON c.atom_id = a.atom_id OR c.atom_id2 = a.atom_id\nWHERE c.bond_id = 'TR004_8_9';\n```\n\nThis query selects the `element` from the `atom` table where the `bond_id` in the `connected` table matches 'TR004_8_9', effectively retrieving the elements of the atoms involved in that bond."
