"To answer the question \"How many bonds which involved atom 12 does molecule TR009 have?\", we need to construct an SQL query that counts the number of bonds associated with the specified molecule and atom.\n\nGiven the evidence, we know that:\n- The molecule ID is `TR009`.\n- The atom involved is `TR009_12`, which can be referenced as either `atom_id` or `atom_id2` in the `connected` table.\n\nWe will need to join the `bond` and `connected` tables to find the relevant bonds for the specified molecule and atom. The SQL query will look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM connected \nJOIN bond ON connected.bond_id = bond.bond_id \nWHERE bond.molecule_id = 'TR009' \nAND (connected.atom_id = 'TR009_12' OR connected.atom_id2 = 'TR009_12');\n```\n\nThis query counts the number of records in the `connected` table that are linked to the `bond` table where the `molecule_id` is `TR009` and either `atom_id` or `atom_id2` matches `TR009_12`."
