"To answer the question regarding Paul di Resta's fastest lap speed in the 853rd race compared to the next race (854th), we need to extract the fastest lap speeds for both races and calculate the percentage difference. \n\nHere's how the SQL query can be structured:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    (SELECT fastestLapSpeed FROM results WHERE driverId = (SELECT driverId FROM drivers WHERE forename = 'Paul' AND surname = 'di Resta') AND raceId = 853) AS speed_853,\n    (SELECT fastestLapSpeed FROM results WHERE driverId = (SELECT driverId FROM drivers WHERE forename = 'Paul' AND surname = 'di Resta') AND raceId = 854) AS speed_854,\n    ((SELECT fastestLapSpeed FROM results WHERE driverId = (SELECT driverId FROM drivers WHERE forename = 'Paul' AND surname = 'di Resta') AND raceId = 853) - \n     (SELECT fastestLapSpeed FROM results WHERE driverId = (SELECT driverId FROM drivers WHERE forename = 'Paul' AND surname = 'di Resta') AND raceId = 854)) / \n     (SELECT fastestLapSpeed FROM results WHERE driverId = (SELECT driverId FROM drivers WHERE forename = 'Paul' AND surname = 'di Resta') AND raceId = 854) * 100 AS percent_faster\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Subqueries**: We use subqueries to fetch the `fastestLapSpeed` for Paul di Resta in both the 853rd and 854th races.\n2. **Calculating Percentage**: The formula for calculating the percentage difference is applied:\n   - Subtract the fastest lap speed of the 854th race from that of the 853rd race.\n   - Divide the result by the fastest lap speed of the 854th race.\n   - Multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n3. **Driver Identification**: We identify Paul di Resta by matching his `forename` and `surname` in the `drivers` table.\n\nThis SQL query will return the fastest lap speeds for both races and the percentage by which Paul di Resta was faster in the 853rd race compared to the 854th race."
