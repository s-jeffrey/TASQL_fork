"To answer the question \"How many atoms with iodine and with sulfur type elements are there in single bond molecules?\", we need to construct an SQL query that counts distinct atoms based on the specified criteria. \n\nHere's how we can break down the requirements:\n\n1. **Identify atoms with iodine and sulfur**: We need to filter the `atom` table for elements 'i' (iodine) and 's' (sulfur).\n2. **Identify single bond molecules**: We need to filter the `bond` table for `bond_type = '-'` (single bond).\n3. **Join the tables**: We need to join the `atom`, `bond`, and `connected` tables to ensure we are only counting atoms that are part of single bonds.\n\nThe SQL query will look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a.atom_id) \nFROM atom a\nJOIN connected c ON a.atom_id = c.atom_id OR a.atom_id = c.atom_id2\nJOIN bond b ON c.bond_id = b.bond_id\nWHERE (a.element = 'i' OR a.element = 's') \nAND b.bond_type = '-';\n```\n\n### Explanation of the SQL:\n- `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a.atom_id)`: This counts the distinct atom IDs that meet the criteria.\n- `FROM atom a`: We start from the `atom` table.\n- `JOIN connected c ON a.atom_id = c.atom_id OR a.atom_id = c.atom_id2`: We join the `connected` table to find connections of the atoms.\n- `JOIN bond b ON c.bond_id = b.bond_id`: We join the `bond` table to filter based on bond types.\n- `WHERE (a.element = 'i' OR a.element = 's')`: This filters for atoms that are either iodine or sulfur.\n- `AND b.bond_type = '-'`: This ensures we only consider single bonds.\n\nThis SQL query will return the count of distinct atoms that are either iodine or sulfur and are part of single bond molecules."
