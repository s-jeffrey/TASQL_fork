"To answer the question \"What's the nationality of the customer who spent 548.4 in 2012/8/24?\", we need to extract the relevant information from the database schema. The key steps are to identify the tables involved, the necessary columns, and the relationships between them.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant tables**: \n   - We need to look at the `transactions_1k` table to find the transaction amount and date.\n   - We also need the `yearmonth` table to find the customer associated with that transaction.\n   - Finally, we need the `customers` table to find the nationality of the customer.\n\n2. **Identify the columns**:\n   - From `transactions_1k`, we need `CustomerID` and `Amount`.\n   - From `yearmonth`, we need `CustomerID` and `Date`.\n   - From `customers`, we need the nationality (assuming nationality is part of the customer information, though it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided schema).\n\n3. **Foreign key relationship**: \n   - We have a foreign key relationship from `yearmonth.CustomerID` to `customers.CustomerID`.\n\n4. **Construct the SQL query**:\n   - We will join the `transactions_1k` table with the `yearmonth` table on `CustomerID` and filter by the date and amount.\n   - Then, we will join the result with the `customers` table to get the nationality.\n\nHere is the SQL query that accomplishes this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT customers.Nationality\nFROM transactions_1k\nJOIN yearmonth ON transactions_1k.CustomerID = yearmonth.CustomerID\nJOIN customers ON yearmonth.CustomerID = customers.CustomerID\nWHERE transactions_1k.Amount = 548.4 AND transactions_1k.Date = '2012-08-24';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the nationality of the customer who spent 548.4 on the specified date. Note that the nationality column is assumed to exist in the `customers` table, as it was not explicitly mentioned in the provided schema."
