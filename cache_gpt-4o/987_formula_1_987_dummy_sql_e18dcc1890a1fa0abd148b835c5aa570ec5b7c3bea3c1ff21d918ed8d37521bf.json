"```sql\nSELECT AVG(CAST(SUBSTRING(fastestLapTime, 1, 2) AS INTEGER) * 60 + \n           CAST(SUBSTRING(fastestLapTime, 4, 5) AS REAL)) AS average_fastest_lap_time\nFROM results\nJOIN races ON results.raceId = races.raceId\nWHERE races.name = 'United States Grand Prix' \n  AND races.year = 2006\n  AND results.rank < 11;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the average fastest lap time of the top 10 drivers in the 2006 United States Grand Prix. It joins the `results` and `races` tables to filter the specific race by name and year, and then selects the average of the `fastestLapTime` for drivers with a rank less than 11. The `fastestLapTime` is converted from a string format to a numeric value in seconds for accurate averaging."
