"```sql\nSELECT users.DisplayName\nFROM badges\nJOIN users ON badges.UserId = users.Id\nGROUP BY users.DisplayName\nORDER BY COUNT(badges.Id) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `badges` table with the `users` table using the `UserId` foreign key relationship. It groups the results by the `DisplayName` of the users and orders them by the count of badges in descending order, returning the display name of the user with the most badges."
