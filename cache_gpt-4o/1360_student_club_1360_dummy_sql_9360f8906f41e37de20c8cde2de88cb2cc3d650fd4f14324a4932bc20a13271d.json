"To answer the question \"What percentage was the budget for Parking to the total budget for the 'November Speaker'?\" using the provided database schema, primary keys, and foreign keys, we need to calculate the percentage of the budget allocated to Parking for the event named \"November Speaker\" relative to the total budget for that event. Here's how you can construct the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    (SUM(b.amount) FILTER (WHERE b.category = 'Parking') / SUM(b.amount)) * 100 AS parking_budget_percentage\nFROM \n    budget b\nJOIN \n    event e ON b.link_to_event = e.event_id\nWHERE \n    e.event_name = 'November Speaker';\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **SUM(b.amount) FILTER (WHERE b.category = 'Parking')**: This part calculates the total amount budgeted for the Parking category for the event \"November Speaker\".\n- **SUM(b.amount)**: This calculates the total budget for the event \"November Speaker\".\n- **(SUM(b.amount) FILTER (WHERE b.category = 'Parking') / SUM(b.amount)) * 100**: This calculates the percentage of the budget allocated to Parking.\n- **JOIN event e ON b.link_to_event = e.event_id**: This joins the `budget` table with the `event` table to filter the budgets related to the \"November Speaker\" event.\n- **WHERE e.event_name = 'November Speaker'**: This filters the results to only include the event named \"November Speaker\"."
