"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM Examination\nJOIN Laboratory ON Examination.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE (Laboratory.SM = 'negative' OR Laboratory.SM = '0')\n  AND Examination.Thrombosis = 0;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of patients who have a normal anti-SM test result (where SM is 'negative' or '0') and do not have thrombosis (where Thrombosis is 0). The query joins the `Examination` and `Laboratory` tables using the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship."
