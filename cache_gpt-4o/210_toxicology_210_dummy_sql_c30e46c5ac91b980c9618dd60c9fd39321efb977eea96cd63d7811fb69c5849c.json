"```sql\nSELECT c.atom_id, c.atom_id2\nFROM connected c\nJOIN bond b ON c.bond_id = b.bond_id\nWHERE b.bond_type = '-';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the atom IDs from the `connected` table where the bond type is a single bond, as indicated by `bond_type = '-'` in the `bond` table. The `JOIN` operation is used to connect the `connected` and `bond` tables through the `bond_id` foreign key relationship."
