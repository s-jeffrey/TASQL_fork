"```sql\nSELECT q.q1\nFROM qualifying q\nJOIN drivers d ON q.driverId = d.driverId\nWHERE d.forename = 'Bruno' AND d.surname = 'Senna' AND q.raceId = 354;\n```\nThis SQL query retrieves the Q1 result for Bruno Senna in the qualifying race with raceId 354. It joins the `qualifying` table with the `drivers` table using the `driverId` foreign key to filter by the driver's full name."
