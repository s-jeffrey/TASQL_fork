"```sql\nSELECT b.bond_type, m.label\nFROM bond b\nJOIN molecule m ON b.molecule_id = m.molecule_id\nWHERE b.molecule_id = 'TR010'\nGROUP BY b.bond_type, m.label\nORDER BY COUNT(b.bond_type) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the bond type that accounts for the majority of the bonds in the molecule with ID 'TR010' and also retrieves whether the molecule is carcinogenic or not. It joins the `bond` and `molecule` tables on the `molecule_id`, filters for the specific molecule, groups by bond type and label, orders by the count of each bond type in descending order, and limits the result to the top entry."
