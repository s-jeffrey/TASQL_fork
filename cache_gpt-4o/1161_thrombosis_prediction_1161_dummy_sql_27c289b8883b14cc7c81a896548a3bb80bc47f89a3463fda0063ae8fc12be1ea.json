"```sql\nSELECT AVG(e.\"aCL IgG\") AS average_aCL_IgG\nFROM Examination e\nJOIN Patient p ON e.ID = p.ID\nWHERE p.Admission = '+'\n  AND (YEAR(CURRENT_DATE) - YEAR(p.Birthday)) >= 50;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the average concentration of anti-cardiolipin antibody (IgG) for patients who are in-patients (indicated by `Admission = '+'`) and are aged 50 or above. The query joins the `Examination` and `Patient` tables using the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship."
