"```sql\nSELECT c.name, l.format\nFROM cards c\nJOIN sets s ON c.setCode = s.code\nJOIN legalities l ON c.uuid = l.uuid\nWHERE s.name = 'Hour of Devastation' AND l.status = 'legal';\n```\nThis SQL query retrieves the names of all cards from the set \"Hour of Devastation\" and the formats in which these cards are legal. It joins the `cards`, `sets`, and `legalities` tables using the appropriate foreign key relationships and filters the results based on the set name and legality status."
