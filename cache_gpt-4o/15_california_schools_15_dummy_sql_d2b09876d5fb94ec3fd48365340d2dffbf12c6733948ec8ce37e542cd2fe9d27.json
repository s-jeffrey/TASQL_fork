"```sql\nSELECT s.District, MAX(ss.AvgScrRead) AS MaxAvgScrRead\nFROM satscores ss\nJOIN schools s ON ss.cds = s.CDSCode\nWHERE s.StatusType = 'Active'\nGROUP BY s.District\nORDER BY MaxAvgScrRead DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `satscores` and `schools` tables using the foreign key relationship between `satscores.cds` and `schools.CDSCode`. It filters for active districts by checking the `StatusType` column in the `schools` table. The query then groups the results by district and selects the district with the highest average reading score (`AvgScrRead`). The result is ordered in descending order of the average reading score, and the `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the district with the highest score is returned."
