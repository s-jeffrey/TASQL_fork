"```sql\nSELECT major.department\nFROM member\nJOIN major ON member.link_to_major = major.major_id\nWHERE member.last_name IN ('Pierce', 'Guidi');\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `member` and `major` tables using the foreign key relationship between `member.link_to_major` and `major.major_id`. It then filters the results to include only those members with the last names 'Pierce' and 'Guidi', and selects the `department` from the `major` table."
