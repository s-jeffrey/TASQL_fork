"To convert the given SR into an executable SQL query, we need to follow the logic described in the SR and ensure it aligns with the schema and question requirements. The goal is to find the percentage of bonds that have the most common combination of atoms' elements.\n\nHere's how we can construct the SQL query:\n\n1. **Identify the most common combination of elements in bonds**: We need to find the combination of elements that appears most frequently in bonds. This involves joining the `connected` table with the `atom` table to get the elements for each bond.\n\n2. **Count the occurrences of each combination**: Group by the combination of elements and count the occurrences.\n\n3. **Find the most common combination**: Order the results by count in descending order and limit to 1 to get the most common combination.\n\n4. **Calculate the percentage of bonds with this combination**: Divide the count of bonds with the most common combination by the total number of bonds and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nHere is the SQL query that implements this logic:\n\n```sql\nWITH ElementCombinations AS (\n    SELECT \n        c.bond_id,\n        a1.element AS element1,\n        a2.element AS element2\n    FROM \n        connected c\n    JOIN \n        atom a1 ON c.atom_id = a1.atom_id\n    JOIN \n        atom a2 ON c.atom_id2 = a2.atom_id\n),\nCombinationCounts AS (\n    SELECT \n        element1, \n        element2, \n        COUNT(*) AS combination_count\n    FROM \n        ElementCombinations\n    GROUP BY \n        element1, element2\n),\nMostCommonCombination AS (\n    SELECT \n        element1, \n        element2, \n        combination_count\n    FROM \n        CombinationCounts\n    ORDER BY \n        combination_count DESC\n    LIMIT 1\n),\nTotalBonds AS (\n    SELECT \n        COUNT(DISTINCT bond_id) AS total_bonds\n    FROM \n        connected\n)\nSELECT \n    (mcc.combination_count * 100.0 / tb.total_bonds) AS percentage\nFROM \n    MostCommonCombination mcc, TotalBonds tb;\n```\n\nThis query calculates the percentage of bonds that have the most common combination of elements by following the steps outlined above."
