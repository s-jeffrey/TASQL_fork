"To generate the SQL query to answer the question \"What is the up vote number of the user that commented 'R is also lazy evaluated.'?\", we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the comment with the text \"R is also lazy evaluated.\" in the `comments` table.\n2. Find the `UserId` associated with this comment.\n3. Use this `UserId` to look up the number of upvotes in the `users` table.\n\nBased on the database schema, the `Text` column in the `comments` table contains the comment text, and the `UserId` column in the `comments` table is a foreign key referencing the `Id` column in the `users` table. The `UpVotes` column in the `users` table contains the number of upvotes for a user.\n\nHere is the SQL query to answer the question:\n\n```sql\nSELECT u.UpVotes\nFROM comments c\nJOIN users u ON c.UserId = u.Id\nWHERE c.Text = 'R is also lazy evaluated.'\n```\n\nThis query joins the `comments` and `users` tables on the `UserId` and `Id` columns, respectively, and filters the results to find the comment with the specified text. It then selects the `UpVotes` for the user who made that comment."
