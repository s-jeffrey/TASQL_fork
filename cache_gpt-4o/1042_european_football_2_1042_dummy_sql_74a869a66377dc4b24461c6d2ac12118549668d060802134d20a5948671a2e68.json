"```sql\nSELECT League.name\nFROM Match\nJOIN League ON Match.league_id = League.id\nWHERE Match.season = '2009/2010'\nGROUP BY League.name\nHAVING AVG(Match.home_team_goal) > AVG(Match.away_team_goal);\n```\nThis SQL query selects the names of leagues where the average number of goals scored by the home team is greater than the average number of goals scored by the away team during the 2009/2010 season. It uses a `JOIN` to connect the `Match` and `League` tables based on the `league_id`, filters matches from the 2009/2010 season, groups the results by league name, and applies a `HAVING` clause to compare the average goals."
