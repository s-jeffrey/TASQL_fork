"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Examination.ID)\nFROM Examination\nJOIN Laboratory ON Examination.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE (Examination.Thrombosis = 2 OR Examination.Thrombosis = 1)\nAND Laboratory.PT < 14;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct patients who have severe thrombosis (Thrombosis = 2 or 1) and a normal prothrombin time (PT < 14). It uses a JOIN operation to connect the `Examination` and `Laboratory` tables based on the patient ID, which is a foreign key relationship."
