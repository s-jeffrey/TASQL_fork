"```sql\nSELECT CONCAT(m.first_name, ' ', m.last_name) AS full_name, i.amount\nFROM income i\nJOIN member m ON i.link_to_member = m.member_id\nWHERE i.date_received = '2019-09-09';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the full names of students who received funds on the specified date, 9/9/2019, and includes the amount received. It joins the `income` table with the `member` table using the foreign key relationship between `income.link_to_member` and `member.member_id`. The `CONCAT` function is used to combine the first and last names into a full name."
