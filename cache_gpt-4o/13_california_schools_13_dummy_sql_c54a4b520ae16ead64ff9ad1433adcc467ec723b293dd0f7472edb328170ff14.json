"```sql\nSELECT s.Phone\nFROM satscores ss\nJOIN schools s ON ss.cds = s.CDSCode\nORDER BY (ss.NumGE1500 * 1.0 / ss.NumTstTakr) DESC\nLIMIT 3;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the phone numbers of the schools with the top 3 SAT excellence rates. It calculates the excellence rate as the number of test takers whose total SAT scores are greater or equal to 1500 divided by the total number of test takers (`NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr`). The query orders the results in descending order based on this calculated rate and limits the output to the top 3 entries."
