"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM bond\nJOIN connected ON bond.bond_id = connected.bond_id\nJOIN atom ON connected.atom_id = atom.atom_id\nWHERE atom.element = 'cl';\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of bonds created by bonding atoms with the chlorine element. It joins the `bond`, `connected`, and `atom` tables to filter bonds where the element of the atom is chlorine (`'cl'`)."
