"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Patient.ID)\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE YEAR(Laboratory.Date) = 1997\nAND (Laboratory.TP <= 6 OR Laboratory.TP >= 8.5);\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct patients who had laboratory tests in 1997 and whose total protein (TP) levels were outside the normal range of 6.0 to 8.5. The query joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables using the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship."
