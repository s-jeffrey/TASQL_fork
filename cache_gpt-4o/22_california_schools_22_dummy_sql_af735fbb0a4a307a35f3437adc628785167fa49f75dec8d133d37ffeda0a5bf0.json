"```sql\nSELECT sname\nFROM satscores\nJOIN schools ON satscores.cds = schools.CDSCode\nWHERE schools.County = 'Contra Costa'\nORDER BY NumTstTakr DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the name of the school (`sname`) from the `satscores` table, joining it with the `schools` table using the foreign key relationship between `satscores.cds` and `schools.CDSCode`. It filters the results to only include schools located in Contra Costa County and orders the results by the number of test takers (`NumTstTakr`) in descending order, returning the school with the highest number of test takers."
