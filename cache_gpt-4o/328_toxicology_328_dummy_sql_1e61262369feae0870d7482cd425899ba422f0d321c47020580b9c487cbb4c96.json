"```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT a.element\nFROM bond b\nJOIN connected c ON b.bond_id = c.bond_id\nJOIN atom a ON c.atom_id = a.atom_id OR c.atom_id2 = a.atom_id\nWHERE b.bond_type = '=' AND b.molecule_id = 'TR024';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects distinct elements from the `atom` table that are part of a double bond in the molecule with ID `TR024`. It joins the `bond`, `connected`, and `atom` tables to find the relevant atoms involved in double bonds."
