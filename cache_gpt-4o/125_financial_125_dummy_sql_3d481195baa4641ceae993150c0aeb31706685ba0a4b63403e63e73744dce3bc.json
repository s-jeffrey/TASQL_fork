"```sql\nSELECT d.A2 AS district_name, \n       ((d.A13 - d.A12) / d.A12) * 100 AS unemployment_increment_percentage\nFROM loan l\nJOIN disp dp ON l.account_id = dp.account_id\nJOIN client c ON dp.client_id = c.client_id\nJOIN district d ON c.district_id = d.district_id\nWHERE l.status = 'D';\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the district name and the percentage increment in unemployment rate from 1995 to 1996 for loans that are still running and where the client is in debt. The query uses the relationships defined in the foreign keys to join the necessary tables and filters the results based on the loan status."
