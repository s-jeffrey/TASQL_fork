"```sql\nSELECT c.id, r.text AS ruling_text, c.hasContentWarning\nFROM cards c\nJOIN rulings r ON c.uuid = r.uuid\nWHERE c.artist = 'Stephen Daniele';\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the card IDs, the text of the rulings, and the content warning status for all cards illustrated by Stephen Daniele. It uses the `cards` and `rulings` tables, joining them on the `uuid` column, which is a foreign key relationship. The query also checks if the cards have missing or degraded properties by including the `hasContentWarning` column."
