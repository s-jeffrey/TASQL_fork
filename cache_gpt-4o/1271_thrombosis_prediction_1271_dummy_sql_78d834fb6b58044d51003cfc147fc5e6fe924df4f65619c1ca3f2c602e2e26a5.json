"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Patient.ID)\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Laboratory.SSA IN ('-', '+-')\nAND YEAR(Patient.`First Date`) < 2000;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct patients who have a normal anti-SSA test result and came to the hospital before the year 2000. The query joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables using the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship, and applies the conditions specified in the evidence."
