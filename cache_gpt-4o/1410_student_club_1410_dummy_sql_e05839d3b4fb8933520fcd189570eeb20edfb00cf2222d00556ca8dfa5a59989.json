"```sql\nSELECT CONCAT(m.first_name, ' ', m.last_name) AS full_name, SUM(e.cost) AS total_cost\nFROM member m\nJOIN expense e ON m.member_id = e.link_to_member\nWHERE m.member_id = 'rec4BLdZHS2Blfp4v'\nGROUP BY m.first_name, m.last_name;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `member` and `expense` tables using the foreign key relationship between `expense.link_to_member` and `member.member_id`. It selects the full name of the member by concatenating the `first_name` and `last_name` fields, and calculates the total cost incurred by summing the `cost` field from the `expense` table. The query filters the results to only include expenses incurred by the member with the ID `rec4BLdZHS2Blfp4v`."
