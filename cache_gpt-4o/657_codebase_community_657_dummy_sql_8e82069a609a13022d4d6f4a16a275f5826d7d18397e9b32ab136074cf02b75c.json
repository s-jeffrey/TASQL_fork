"```sql\nSELECT u.DisplayName, u.WebsiteUrl\nFROM votes v\nJOIN users u ON v.UserId = u.Id\nWHERE v.VoteTypeId = 8\nORDER BY v.BountyAmount DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `votes` and `users` tables using the foreign key relationship `votes.UserId = users.Id`. It filters the votes to only those with a `VoteTypeId` of 8, orders the results by `BountyAmount` in descending order to find the highest bounty, and limits the result to the top entry. The query selects only the `DisplayName` and `WebsiteUrl` of the user, as specified in the question."
