"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Laboratory.ALP >= 300 AND Patient.Admission = '+';\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of patients who have an abnormal alkaliphophatase level (ALP >= 300) and are admitted to the hospital (Admission = '+'). The query joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables using the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship."
