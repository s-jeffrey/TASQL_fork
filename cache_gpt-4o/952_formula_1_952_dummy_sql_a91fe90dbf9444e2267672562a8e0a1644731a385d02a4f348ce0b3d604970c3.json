"```sql\nSELECT constructors.name\nFROM constructors\nJOIN constructorStandings ON constructors.constructorId = constructorStandings.constructorId\nWHERE constructorStandings.position = 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the names of constructors who have been ranked 1 in the constructor standings. It joins the `constructors` table with the `constructorStandings` table using the `constructorId` as the foreign key and filters the results where the `position` is 1."
