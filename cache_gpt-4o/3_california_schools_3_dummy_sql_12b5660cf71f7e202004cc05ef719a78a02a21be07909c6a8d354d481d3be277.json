"```sql\nSELECT schools.MailStreet\nFROM frpm\nJOIN schools ON frpm.CDSCode = schools.CDSCode\nORDER BY frpm.`FRPM Count (K-12)` DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the unabbreviated mailing street address (`MailStreet`) of the school with the highest FRPM count for K-12 students. It joins the `frpm` table with the `schools` table using the `CDSCode` as the foreign key and orders the results by the `FRPM Count (K-12)` in descending order, limiting the output to the top result."
