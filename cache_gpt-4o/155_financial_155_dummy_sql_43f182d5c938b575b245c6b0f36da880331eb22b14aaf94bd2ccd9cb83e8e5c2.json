"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(CASE WHEN type = 'gold' AND issued < '1998-01-01' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS percent_of_gold_issued_prior_1998\nFROM \n  card;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of 'Gold' cards that were issued before the year 1998. It uses a conditional `COUNT` to count only those rows where the card type is 'gold' and the issued date is before 1998, and then divides this by the total count of all cards to get the percentage."
