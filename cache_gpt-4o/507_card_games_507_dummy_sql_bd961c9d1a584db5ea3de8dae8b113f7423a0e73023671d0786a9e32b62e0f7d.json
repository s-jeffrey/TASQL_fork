"```sql\nSELECT \n    (SUM(CASE WHEN c.isOnlineOnly = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS percentage_online_only\nFROM \n    cards c\nJOIN \n    set_translations st ON c.setCode = st.setCode\nWHERE \n    st.language = 'Portuguese (Brazil)';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of cards that are only available online among those that have a Brazil Portuguese translation. It joins the `cards` table with the `set_translations` table using the `setCode` and filters for entries where the language is 'Portuguese (Brazil)'. It then calculates the percentage of these cards that are marked as `isOnlineOnly`."
