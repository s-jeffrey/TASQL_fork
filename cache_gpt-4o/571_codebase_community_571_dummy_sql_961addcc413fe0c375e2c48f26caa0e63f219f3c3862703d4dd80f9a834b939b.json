"```sql\nSELECT \n    (SELECT COUNT(posts.Id) FROM posts WHERE posts.OwnerUserId = 24) / \n    (SELECT COUNT(votes.Id) FROM votes WHERE votes.UserId = 24) AS PostToVoteRatio;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the ratio of the number of posts to the number of votes for the user with UserId 24. It uses subqueries to count the number of posts and votes separately and then divides the two counts to get the desired ratio."
