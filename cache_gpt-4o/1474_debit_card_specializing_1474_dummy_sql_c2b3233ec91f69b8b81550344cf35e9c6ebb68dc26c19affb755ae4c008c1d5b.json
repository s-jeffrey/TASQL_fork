"```sql\nSELECT c.CustomerID\nFROM customers c\nJOIN yearmonth ym ON c.CustomerID = ym.CustomerID\nWHERE c.Currency = 'CZK' AND ym.Date BETWEEN '201101' AND '201112'\nORDER BY ym.Consumption DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the `CustomerID` of customers who pay in CZK and consumed the most gas in the year 2011. It joins the `customers` table with the `yearmonth` table using the `CustomerID` as the foreign key. The query filters the results to include only those records where the `Currency` is 'CZK' and the `Date` is between '201101' and '201112', which corresponds to the year 2011. The results are ordered by `Consumption` in descending order to find the customer with the highest consumption, and the `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the top result is returned."
