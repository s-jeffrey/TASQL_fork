"```sql\nSELECT major.college\nFROM member\nJOIN major ON member.link_to_major = major.major_id\nGROUP BY major.college\nORDER BY COUNT(member.member_id) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `member` and `major` tables using the foreign key relationship between `member.link_to_major` and `major.major_id`. It then groups the results by `major.college` and orders them by the count of members in descending order, selecting the college with the most members."
