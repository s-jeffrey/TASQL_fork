"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Player_Attributes)) AS percentage\nFROM \n  Player_Attributes\nWHERE \n  strength > 80 AND stamina > 80;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of players who have both a strength and stamina score greater than 80. It does this by counting the number of players meeting the criteria and dividing it by the total number of players in the `Player_Attributes` table, then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage."
