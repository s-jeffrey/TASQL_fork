"To answer the question about calculating the percentage of users who obtained the \"Teacher\" badge, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Count the number of distinct users who have obtained the \"Teacher\" badge.\n2. Count the total number of distinct users in the badges table.\n3. Calculate the percentage by dividing the count from step 1 by the count from step 2 and multiplying by 100.\n\nHere's the SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN Name = 'Teacher' THEN UserId END) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT UserId)) AS TeacherBadgePercentage\nFROM \n  badges;\n```\n\nThis query uses a `CASE` statement to count only those `UserId`s where the `Name` of the badge is \"Teacher\" and then calculates the percentage of these users out of the total distinct users in the `badges` table."
