"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT attendance.link_to_member)\nFROM attendance\nJOIN event ON attendance.link_to_event = event.event_id\nWHERE event.event_name = 'Women''s Soccer';\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct members who attended the event named \"Women's Soccer\" by joining the `attendance` table with the `event` table using the foreign key relationship. The `event_name` is used to filter the specific event. Note that in SQL, single quotes within a string are escaped by doubling them."
