"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id) AS total_carcinogenic_molecules\nFROM molecule m\nJOIN bond b ON m.molecule_id = b.molecule_id\nWHERE b.bond_type = '=' AND m.label = '+';\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct molecules that have a double bond type and are labeled as carcinogenic. It uses a join between the `molecule` and `bond` tables based on the `molecule_id` and applies the conditions specified in the question and evidence."
