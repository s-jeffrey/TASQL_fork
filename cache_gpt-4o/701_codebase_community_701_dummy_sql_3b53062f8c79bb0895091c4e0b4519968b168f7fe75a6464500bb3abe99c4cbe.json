"```sql\nSELECT \n    (CAST(COUNT(p.Id) AS FLOAT) / CAST((SELECT COUNT(Id) FROM posts WHERE OwnerUserId = u.Id) AS FLOAT)) * 100 AS Percentage\nFROM \n    users u\nJOIN \n    posts p ON u.Id = p.OwnerUserId\nWHERE \n    u.Reputation = (SELECT MAX(Reputation) FROM users)\n    AND p.Score > 50;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Identify the Most Influential User**: The user with the highest reputation is considered the most influential. This is determined by `u.Reputation = (SELECT MAX(Reputation) FROM users)`.\n\n2. **Filter Posts by the Most Influential User**: We join the `users` and `posts` tables on `OwnerUserId` to filter posts made by this user.\n\n3. **Count Posts with Score Above 50**: We count the posts where `p.Score > 50`.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Number of Posts by the User**: We calculate the total number of posts by the most influential user using a subquery `(SELECT COUNT(Id) FROM posts WHERE OwnerUserId = u.Id)`.\n\n5. **Calculate the Percentage**: The percentage is calculated by dividing the count of posts with a score above 50 by the total number of posts by the user, and then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage."
