"```sql\nSELECT \n    COUNT(CASE WHEN YEAR(CreationDate) = 2010 THEN 1 END) / \n    COUNT(CASE WHEN YEAR(CreationDate) = 2011 THEN 1 END) AS vote_ratio\nFROM \n    votes;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the ratio of the number of votes in 2010 to the number of votes in 2011 from the `votes` table. It uses conditional aggregation to count the votes for each year and then divides the two counts to get the ratio."
