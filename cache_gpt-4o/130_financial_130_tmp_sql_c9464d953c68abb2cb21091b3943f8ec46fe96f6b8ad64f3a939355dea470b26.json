"To convert the given SR (Structured Representation) into an executable SQL query, we need to follow the logic described in the SR and ensure it aligns with the schema and evidence provided. The goal is to count the number of account holders in the \"South Bohemia\" region who do not own credit cards.\n\nHere's how we can construct the SQL query:\n\n1. **Filter by Region**: We need to join the `district` table to filter accounts located in \"South Bohemia\".\n2. **Identify Account Holders Without Credit Cards**: We need to find account holders who do not have an entry in the `card` table, which can be done using a `LEFT JOIN` and checking for `NULL` in the `card.card_id`.\n3. **Count the Results**: Finally, we count the number of such account holders.\n\nHere is the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT disp.client_id) AS account_holders_without_cards\nFROM disp\nINNER JOIN account ON disp.account_id = account.account_id\nINNER JOIN district ON account.district_id = district.district_id\nLEFT JOIN card ON disp.disp_id = card.disp_id\nWHERE district.A3 = 'south Bohemia' AND card.card_id IS NULL;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`INNER JOIN`**: We join `disp` with `account` and `district` to filter accounts based on the region \"South Bohemia\".\n- **`LEFT JOIN`**: We use a `LEFT JOIN` between `disp` and `card` to include all account holders and identify those without a credit card (`card.card_id IS NULL`).\n- **`COUNT(DISTINCT disp.client_id)`**: We count distinct `client_id`s to ensure each account holder is counted only once.\n- **`WHERE` Clause**: Filters for the region \"South Bohemia\" and ensures the account holder does not have a credit card."
