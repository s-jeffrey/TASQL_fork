"To answer the question \"How often does account number 3 request an account statement to be released? What was the aim of debiting 3539 in total?\" using the provided database schema, we need to focus on the `trans` table, specifically the `k_symbol` column, which describes the purpose of transactions, and the `amount` column to find the total debited amount.\n\nHere's how you can construct the SQL query:\n\n1. **Identify account number 3 transactions**: We need to filter transactions related to account number 3.\n2. **Count the number of account statement requests**: This involves counting the occurrences of a specific `k_symbol` value that represents an account statement request.\n3. **Find the purpose of debiting 3539 in total**: This involves filtering transactions where the total debited amount is 3539 and checking the `k_symbol` for these transactions.\n\nAssuming that the `k_symbol` for account statement requests is 'SLUZBY' (as it stands for payment for statement), the SQL query would look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    COUNT(*) AS statement_request_count,\n    k_symbol\nFROM \n    trans\nWHERE \n    account_id = 3\n    AND (k_symbol = 'SLUZBY' OR amount = 3539)\nGROUP BY \n    k_symbol\nHAVING \n    SUM(amount) = 3539 OR k_symbol = 'SLUZBY';\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`COUNT(*) AS statement_request_count`**: Counts how many times the account statement was requested.\n- **`k_symbol`**: Selects the purpose of the transactions.\n- **`WHERE account_id = 3`**: Filters transactions for account number 3.\n- **`AND (k_symbol = 'SLUZBY' OR amount = 3539)`**: Ensures we only consider transactions that are either account statement requests or have a total debited amount of 3539.\n- **`GROUP BY k_symbol`**: Groups the results by the purpose of the transaction.\n- **`HAVING SUM(amount) = 3539 OR k_symbol = 'SLUZBY'`**: Ensures that we only include groups where the total debited amount is 3539 or the purpose is an account statement request."
