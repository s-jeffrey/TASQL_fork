"```sql\nSELECT \n  (SUM(CASE WHEN a.element = 'c' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(a.atom_id)) AS carbon_percentage\nFROM \n  molecule m\nJOIN \n  bond b ON m.molecule_id = b.molecule_id\nJOIN \n  connected c ON b.bond_id = c.bond_id\nJOIN \n  atom a ON c.atom_id = a.atom_id\nWHERE \n  b.bond_type = '='\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of carbon atoms in molecules that have at least one double bond. It joins the necessary tables based on the foreign key relationships and filters for double bonds. Then, it calculates the percentage of carbon atoms by dividing the count of carbon atoms by the total number of atoms in the selected molecules."
