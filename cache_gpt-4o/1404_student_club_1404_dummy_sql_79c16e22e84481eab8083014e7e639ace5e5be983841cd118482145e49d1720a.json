"```sql\nSELECT e.expense_description, SUM(e.cost) AS total_value\nFROM expense e\nJOIN budget b ON e.link_to_budget = b.budget_id\nJOIN event ev ON b.link_to_event = ev.event_id\nWHERE ev.event_name = 'October Meeting' AND e.approved = 'true'\nGROUP BY e.expense_description;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `expense`, `budget`, and `event` tables to find the types of expenses and their total approved value for the event named 'October Meeting'. It uses the `SUM` function to calculate the total cost of each expense type and filters the results to include only approved expenses."
