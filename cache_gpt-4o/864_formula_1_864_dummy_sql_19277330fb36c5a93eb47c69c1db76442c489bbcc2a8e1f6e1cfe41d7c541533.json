"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM results\nJOIN races ON results.raceId = races.raceId\nWHERE races.date = '2015-11-29' AND results.time IS NOT NULL;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of drivers who finished the race on November 29, 2015. It does this by joining the `results` table with the `races` table using the `raceId` foreign key and filtering for records where the `date` is '2015-11-29' and the `time` column in the `results` table is not null, indicating that the driver finished the race."
