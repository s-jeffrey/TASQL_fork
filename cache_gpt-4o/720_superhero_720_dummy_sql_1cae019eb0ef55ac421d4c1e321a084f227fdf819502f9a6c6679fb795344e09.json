"```sql\nSELECT s.full_name\nFROM superhero s\nJOIN hero_power hp ON s.id = hp.hero_id\nGROUP BY s.id\nHAVING COUNT(hp.power_id) > 15;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the full names of superheroes who have more than 15 superpowers. It joins the `superhero` table with the `hero_power` table using the `hero_id` foreign key, groups the results by superhero ID, and filters the groups to include only those with a count of associated power IDs greater than 15."
