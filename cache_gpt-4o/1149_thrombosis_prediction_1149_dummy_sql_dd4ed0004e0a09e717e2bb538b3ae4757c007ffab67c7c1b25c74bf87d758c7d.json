"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(CASE WHEN Admission = '+' THEN ID END) - COUNT(CASE WHEN Admission = '-' THEN ID END)) * 100.0 / COUNT(CASE WHEN Admission = '-' THEN ID END) AS percentage_deviation\nFROM \n  Patient\nWHERE \n  SEX = 'M';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage deviation between the number of male in-patients and male outpatients. It uses conditional aggregation to count the number of male in-patients and outpatients and then computes the deviation as a percentage of the number of male outpatients."
