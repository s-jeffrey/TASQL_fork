"To answer the question \"How much faster in percentage is the champion than the driver who finished the race last in the 2008 Australian Grand Prix?\", we need to calculate the percentage difference between the champion's time and the last driver's time. Here's how you can construct the SQL query:\n\n1. Identify the race ID for the 2008 Australian Grand Prix.\n2. Retrieve the champion's finish time and the last driver's finish time for that race.\n3. Calculate the percentage difference using the formula provided in the evidence.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    ((last_driver_time - champion_time) / last_driver_time) * 100 AS percentage_faster\nFROM (\n    SELECT \n        MIN(CASE WHEN positionOrder = 1 THEN milliseconds END) AS champion_time,\n        MAX(CASE WHEN positionOrder = (SELECT MAX(positionOrder) FROM results WHERE raceId = r.raceId) THEN milliseconds END) AS last_driver_time\n    FROM results r\n    JOIN races ra ON r.raceId = ra.raceId\n    WHERE ra.year = 2008 AND ra.name = 'Australian Grand Prix'\n) AS times;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The subquery selects the `milliseconds` for the champion (positionOrder = 1) and the last driver (maximum positionOrder) for the 2008 Australian Grand Prix.\n- The main query calculates the percentage difference using the formula: `((last_driver_time - champion_time) / last_driver_time) * 100`."
