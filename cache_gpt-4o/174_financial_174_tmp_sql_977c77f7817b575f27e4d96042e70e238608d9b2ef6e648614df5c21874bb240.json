"To convert the given SR (Structured Representation) into an executable SQL query, we need to follow the logic of the SR and ensure that the SQL query accurately answers the question based on the provided schema and column descriptions.\n\nThe question asks for the birth year of the account owner with client ID 130. The SR indicates that we need to filter the `disp` table for `client_id` 130, then select the `birth_date` from the `client` table, and finally extract the year from the `birth_date`.\n\nHere's how we can construct the SQL query:\n\n1. **Join the `disp` and `client` tables**: We need to join these tables on `disp.client_id = client.client_id` to access the `birth_date` of the client.\n\n2. **Filter for `client_id` 130**: We apply a filter to get the specific client.\n\n3. **Select the year from `birth_date`**: We use the `YEAR()` function to extract the year from the `birth_date`.\n\nHere is the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT YEAR(client.birth_date) AS birth_year\nFROM disp\nINNER JOIN client ON disp.client_id = client.client_id\nWHERE disp.client_id = 130;\n```\n\nThis query will return the birth year of the account owner with client ID 130."
