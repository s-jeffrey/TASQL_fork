"```sql\nSELECT circuits.name AS circuit_name, races.year, results.fastestLapTime\nFROM circuits\nJOIN races ON races.circuitId = circuits.circuitId\nJOIN results ON results.raceId = races.raceId\nWHERE circuits.country = 'Italy'\nORDER BY circuits.name, races.year;\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the lap records (fastest lap times) for circuits located in Italy. It joins the `circuits`, `races`, and `results` tables to get the necessary information and filters the results to only include circuits in Italy. The results are ordered by circuit name and year."
