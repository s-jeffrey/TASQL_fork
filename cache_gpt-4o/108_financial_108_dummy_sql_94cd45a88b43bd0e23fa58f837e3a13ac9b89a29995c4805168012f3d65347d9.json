"```sql\nSELECT t.amount\nFROM client c\nJOIN disp d ON c.client_id = d.client_id\nJOIN loan l ON d.account_id = l.account_id\nJOIN trans t ON t.account_id = l.account_id\nJOIN account a ON a.account_id = l.account_id\nWHERE l.amount = (\n    SELECT MAX(amount)\n    FROM loan\n)\nAND t.date = (\n    SELECT MIN(t2.date)\n    FROM trans t2\n    WHERE t2.account_id = a.account_id\n)\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query is designed to find the first transaction amount for the client who applied for the largest loan. Here's a breakdown of the query:\n\n1. **Joins**: The query joins several tables (`client`, `disp`, `loan`, `trans`, and `account`) to connect the client with their transactions and loans.\n\n2. **Subquery for Maximum Loan**: The subquery `(SELECT MAX(amount) FROM loan)` finds the largest loan amount.\n\n3. **Subquery for First Transaction**: The subquery `(SELECT MIN(t2.date) FROM trans t2 WHERE t2.account_id = a.account_id)` finds the earliest transaction date for the account associated with the largest loan.\n\n4. **Main Query**: The main query selects the transaction amount (`t.amount`) for the first transaction after the account was opened, for the client who took the largest loan.\n\n5. **Limit**: The `LIMIT 1` ensures that only one result is returned, in case of ties in transaction dates."
