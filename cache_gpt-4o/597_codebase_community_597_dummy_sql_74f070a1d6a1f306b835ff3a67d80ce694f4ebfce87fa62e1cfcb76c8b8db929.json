"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT users.Id)\nFROM users\nJOIN badges ON users.Id = badges.UserId\nWHERE users.Location LIKE '%India%'\nAND badges.Name = 'Teacher';\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct users from India who have obtained the \"Teacher\" badge. It joins the `users` and `badges` tables using the foreign key relationship `badges.UserId = users.Id`, filters users based on their location containing \"India\", and checks if the badge name is \"Teacher\"."
