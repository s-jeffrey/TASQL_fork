"```sql\nSELECT r.year, AVG(TIME_TO_SEC(STR_TO_DATE(res.time, '%H:%i:%s.%f'))) AS average_champion_time_seconds\nFROM results res\nJOIN races r ON res.raceId = r.raceId\nWHERE res.positionOrder = 1\nAND res.time IS NOT NULL\nAND r.year < 1975\nGROUP BY r.year;\n```\nThis SQL query calculates the average time in seconds for the champion (positionOrder = 1) for each year before 1975. It joins the `results` and `races` tables using the `raceId` foreign key, filters for champions with a non-null finish time, and groups the results by year. The `TIME_TO_SEC` and `STR_TO_DATE` functions are used to convert the time format to seconds."
