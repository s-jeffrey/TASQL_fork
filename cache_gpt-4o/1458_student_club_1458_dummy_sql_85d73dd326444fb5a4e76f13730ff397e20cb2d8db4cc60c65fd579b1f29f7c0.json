"To generate the SQL query to answer the question \"Calculate the difference in the percentage of members in New Jersey and Vermont,\" we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant tables and columns**: \n   - We need to use the `member` table to get the members' information.\n   - We need to use the `zip_code` table to get the state information corresponding to each member's zip code.\n\n2. **Join the tables**: \n   - Use the foreign key relationship `member.zip` to `zip_code.zip_code` to join these tables.\n\n3. **Calculate the percentage of members in each state**:\n   - Count the total number of members.\n   - Count the number of members in New Jersey and Vermont.\n   - Calculate the percentage of members in each state.\n\n4. **Calculate the difference in percentages**:\n   - Subtract the percentage of members in Vermont from the percentage of members in New Jersey.\n\nHere's the SQL query that accomplishes this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    (nj_count * 1.0 / total_count) - (vt_count * 1.0 / total_count) AS percentage_difference\nFROM (\n    SELECT \n        SUM(CASE WHEN z.state = 'New Jersey' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS nj_count,\n        SUM(CASE WHEN z.state = 'Vermont' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS vt_count,\n        COUNT(m.member_id) AS total_count\n    FROM \n        member m\n    JOIN \n        zip_code z ON m.zip = z.zip_code\n    WHERE \n        m.position = 'Member'\n) AS counts;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Subquery**: The subquery calculates the number of members in New Jersey (`nj_count`), Vermont (`vt_count`), and the total number of members (`total_count`).\n- **Main Query**: The main query calculates the percentage difference by dividing the counts by the total number of members and subtracting the Vermont percentage from the New Jersey percentage.\n- **Multiplication by 1.0**: This ensures that the division results in a floating-point number, which is necessary for percentage calculations."
