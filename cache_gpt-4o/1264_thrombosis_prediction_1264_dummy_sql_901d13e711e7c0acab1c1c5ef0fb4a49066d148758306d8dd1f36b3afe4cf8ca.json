"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e.ID)\nFROM Examination e\nJOIN Laboratory l ON e.ID = l.ID\nWHERE e.Thrombosis > 0\nAND l.C4 > 10;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct patients who have blood clots in veins (indicated by a Thrombosis value greater than 0 in the Examination table) and have a normal level of complement 4 (C4 greater than 10 in the Laboratory table). The query uses a JOIN operation to link the Examination and Laboratory tables based on the patient ID, which is a foreign key relationship."
