"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Laboratory.CRP = '+' AND Patient.Description IS NULL;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of patients who have an abnormal C-reactive protein level (indicated by `CRP = '+'`) and do not have their data recorded (indicated by `Description IS NULL`). The query joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables using the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship."
