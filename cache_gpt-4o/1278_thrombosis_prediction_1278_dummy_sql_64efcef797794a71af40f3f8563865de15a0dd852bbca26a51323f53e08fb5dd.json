"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE IGG > 900 AND IGG < 2000 AND Admission = '+';\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of patients who have a normal level of IGG (between 900 and 2000) and were admitted to the hospital (Admission = '+'). The query joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables on the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship."
