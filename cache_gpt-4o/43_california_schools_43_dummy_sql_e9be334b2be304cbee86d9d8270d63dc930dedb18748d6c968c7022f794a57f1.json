"```sql\nSELECT satscores.AvgScrMath, schools.County\nFROM satscores\nJOIN schools ON satscores.cds = schools.CDSCode\nORDER BY (satscores.AvgScrMath + satscores.AvgScrRead + satscores.AvgScrWrite) ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the average math score (`AvgScrMath`) and the county (`County`) of the school with the lowest average score across all subjects (Math, Reading, and Writing) from the `satscores` table. It joins the `satscores` table with the `schools` table using the foreign key relationship between `satscores.cds` and `schools.CDSCode`. The results are ordered in ascending order based on the sum of the average scores for all subjects, and the query returns the first result, which corresponds to the school with the lowest total average score."
