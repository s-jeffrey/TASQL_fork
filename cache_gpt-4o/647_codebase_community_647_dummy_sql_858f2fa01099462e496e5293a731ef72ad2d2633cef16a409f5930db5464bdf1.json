"```sql\nSELECT badges.Name\nFROM badges\nJOIN users ON badges.UserId = users.Id\nWHERE YEAR(badges.Date) = 2011 AND users.Location = 'North Pole';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the badge names from the `badges` table for users whose location is \"North Pole\" and who received the badges in the year 2011. It uses a join between the `badges` and `users` tables based on the foreign key relationship `badges.UserId = users.Id`. The condition `YEAR(badges.Date) = 2011` ensures that only badges received in 2011 are considered."
