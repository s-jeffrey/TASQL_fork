"```sql\nSELECT \n    MAX(YEAR(Birthday)) - MIN(YEAR(Birthday)) AS age_gap\nFROM \n    Patient\nJOIN \n    Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE \n    TG < 200;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the age gap between the youngest and oldest patient who has a normal triglyceride level recorded (TG < 200). It joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables using the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship, and filters the results to only include records where the triglyceride level is less than 200. The age gap is calculated by subtracting the minimum birth year from the maximum birth year."
