"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT comments.PostId)\nFROM comments\nJOIN posts ON comments.PostId = posts.Id\nWHERE comments.Score = 0 AND posts.ViewCount < 5;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct posts that have comments with a score of 0 and a view count lower than 5. It uses a JOIN operation to connect the `comments` and `posts` tables based on the foreign key relationship between `comments.PostId` and `posts.Id`."
