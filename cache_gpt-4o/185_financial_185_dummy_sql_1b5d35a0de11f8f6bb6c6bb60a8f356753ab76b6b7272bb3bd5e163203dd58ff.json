"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(DISTINCT client.client_id) FILTER (WHERE client.gender = 'F')::float / COUNT(DISTINCT client.client_id) * 100) AS female_percentage\nFROM \n  client\nJOIN \n  disp ON client.client_id = disp.client_id\nJOIN \n  account ON disp.account_id = account.account_id\nJOIN \n  district ON account.district_id = district.district_id\nWHERE \n  district.A3 = 'Prague';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of female clients who have accounts at branches located in the Prague district. It uses the `COUNT` function with a `FILTER` clause to count only female clients and divides it by the total number of clients with accounts in Prague, multiplying by 100 to get the percentage. The `JOIN` operations are used to connect the relevant tables based on the foreign key relationships."
