"```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT d.A2 AS district_name\nFROM trans t\nJOIN account a ON t.account_id = a.account_id\nJOIN client c ON a.account_id = c.client_id\nJOIN district d ON c.district_id = d.district_id\nWHERE t.amount > 10000\nAND t.date BETWEEN '1997-01-01' AND '1997-12-31';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the distinct district names from the `district` table where transactions greater than $10,000 occurred in 1997. It joins the `trans`, `account`, `client`, and `district` tables using the appropriate foreign key relationships to filter and retrieve the required information."
