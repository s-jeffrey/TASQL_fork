"```sql\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE Segment = 'Premium')::float / COUNT(*)) * 100 AS premium_percentage\nFROM \n    gasstations\nWHERE \n    Country = 'SVK';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of gas stations in the \"Premium\" segment against the overall segment in the country \"SVK\". It uses a filtered count to determine the number of \"Premium\" segment gas stations and divides it by the total number of gas stations in \"SVK\", then multiplies by 100 to get the percentage."
