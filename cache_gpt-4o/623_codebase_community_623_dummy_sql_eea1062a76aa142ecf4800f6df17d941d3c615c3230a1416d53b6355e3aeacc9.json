"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM badges\nJOIN users ON badges.UserId = users.Id\nWHERE badges.Name = 'Supporter' AND users.Age > 65;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of users who are classified as \"elders\" (Age > 65) and have obtained the \"Supporter\" badge. It joins the `badges` table with the `users` table using the foreign key relationship `badges.UserId = users.Id` and applies the necessary filters in the `WHERE` clause."
