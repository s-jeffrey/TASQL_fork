"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE setCode = 'CSP')) AS percentage\nFROM \n  cards\nWHERE \n  convertedManaCost = 7 AND setCode = 'CSP';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of cards with a converted mana cost of 7 in the set \"Coldsnap\". The set code for Coldsnap is assumed to be 'CSP' based on typical set code conventions. The query counts the number of cards with a converted mana cost of 7 in the specified set and divides it by the total number of cards in that set, then multiplies by 100 to get the percentage."
