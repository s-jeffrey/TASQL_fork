"```sql\nSELECT Patient.ID, Patient.SEX, \n       YEAR(CURRENT_DATE) - YEAR(Patient.Birthday) AS age\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Laboratory.GLU >= 180\n  AND Laboratory.T-CHO < 250;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the ID, sex, and calculated age of patients whose blood glucose (GLU) levels are not within the normal range (GLU >= 180) but whose total cholesterol (T-CHO) levels are within the normal range (T-CHO < 250). The age is calculated by subtracting the birth year from the current year. The query joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables using the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship."
