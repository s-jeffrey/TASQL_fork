"```sql\nSELECT e.event_name\nFROM event e\nJOIN budget b ON e.event_id = b.link_to_event\nJOIN expense ex ON b.budget_id = ex.link_to_budget\nWHERE b.category = 'Parking'\nGROUP BY e.event_name\nHAVING AVG(ex.cost) < (\n  SELECT AVG(ex2.cost)\n  FROM expense ex2\n  JOIN budget b2 ON ex2.link_to_budget = b2.budget_id\n  WHERE b2.category = 'Parking'\n);\n```\nThis SQL query selects the names of events where the average parking cost is less than the overall average parking cost. It uses a `JOIN` to connect the `event`, `budget`, and `expense` tables, and applies a `HAVING` clause to filter events based on the average cost condition."
