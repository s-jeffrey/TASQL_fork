"```sql\nSELECT d.code\nFROM qualifying q\nJOIN drivers d ON q.driverId = d.driverId\nWHERE q.raceId = 45 AND q.q3 LIKE '1:33%';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the abbreviated code of the driver who participated in race number 45 and had a Q3 time starting with '1:33'. The query joins the `qualifying` table with the `drivers` table using the `driverId` as the foreign key to retrieve the driver's code."
