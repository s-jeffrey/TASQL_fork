"```sql\nSELECT d.forename, d.surname, r.year, r.name, r.date, r.time\nFROM drivers d\nJOIN qualifying q ON d.driverId = q.driverId\nJOIN races r ON q.raceId = r.raceId\nWHERE d.dob = (SELECT MAX(dob) FROM drivers)\nORDER BY r.date ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query finds the year, name, date, and time of the first qualifying race for the youngest driver. It does this by joining the `drivers`, `qualifying`, and `races` tables, filtering for the driver with the latest date of birth (youngest), and ordering the results by race date to find the first qualifying race."
