"```sql\nSELECT ph.PostHistoryTypeId, COUNT(DISTINCT c.UserId) AS UniqueUserCount\nFROM postHistory ph\nJOIN comments c ON c.PostId = ph.PostId\nWHERE ph.PostId = 3720\nGROUP BY ph.PostHistoryTypeId;\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the post history type IDs for a specific post (with ID 3720) and counts the number of unique users who have commented on that post. It uses a join between the `postHistory` and `comments` tables based on the `PostId` to gather the necessary information."
