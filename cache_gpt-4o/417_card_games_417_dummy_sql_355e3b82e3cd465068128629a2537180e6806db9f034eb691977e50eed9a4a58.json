"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(CASE WHEN st.language = 'Japanese' AND s.type = 'expansion' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(CASE WHEN st.language = 'Japanese' THEN 1 END)) AS percentage_of_japanese_expansion_sets\nFROM \n  set_translations st\nJOIN \n  sets s ON st.setCode = s.code;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of Japanese translated sets that are expansion sets by joining the `set_translations` and `sets` tables on the `setCode` and `code` columns, respectively. It uses a conditional count to determine the number of Japanese translated sets that are expansion sets and divides it by the total number of Japanese translated sets, multiplying by 100 to get the percentage."
