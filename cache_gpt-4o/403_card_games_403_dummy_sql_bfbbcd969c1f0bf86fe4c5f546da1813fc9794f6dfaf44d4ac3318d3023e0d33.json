"```sql\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(fd.id) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(id) FROM cards)) AS percentage_of_spanish_cards,\n    c.name\nFROM \n    foreign_data fd\nJOIN \n    cards c ON fd.uuid = c.uuid\nWHERE \n    fd.language = 'Spanish'\nGROUP BY \n    c.name;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of cards that have a Spanish translation and lists them by their name. It uses a join between the `foreign_data` and `cards` tables based on the `uuid` foreign key relationship. The query filters for rows where the language is Spanish and calculates the percentage by dividing the count of Spanish cards by the total number of cards, then multiplying by 100. The results are grouped by the card name."
