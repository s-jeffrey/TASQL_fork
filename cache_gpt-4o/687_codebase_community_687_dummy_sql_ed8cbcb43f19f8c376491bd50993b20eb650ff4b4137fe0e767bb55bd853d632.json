"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM comments\nWHERE PostId = (\n    SELECT Id\n    FROM posts\n    ORDER BY Score DESC\n    LIMIT 1\n);\n```\n\nThis SQL query first identifies the post with the highest score by ordering the `posts` table by the `Score` column in descending order and selecting the top result. It then counts the number of comments associated with that post by using the `PostId` in the `comments` table."
