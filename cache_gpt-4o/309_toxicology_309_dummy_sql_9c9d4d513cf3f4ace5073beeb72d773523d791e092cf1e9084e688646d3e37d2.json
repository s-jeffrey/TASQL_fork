"```sql\nSELECT a.atom_id, COUNT(DISTINCT b.bond_type) AS bond_type_count\nFROM atom a\nJOIN bond b ON a.molecule_id = b.molecule_id\nWHERE a.molecule_id = 'TR346'\nGROUP BY a.atom_id;\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the `atom_id` for atoms that belong to the molecule with `molecule_id` 'TR346' and counts the distinct types of bonds (`bond_type`) that can be created by this molecule. The query joins the `atom` and `bond` tables on the `molecule_id` to ensure that the bonds are associated with the same molecule. The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the results by `atom_id`, and the `COUNT(DISTINCT b.bond_type)` function is used to count the unique bond types for each atom."
