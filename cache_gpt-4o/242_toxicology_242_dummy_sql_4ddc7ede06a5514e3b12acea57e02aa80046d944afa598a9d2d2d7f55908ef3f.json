"```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT m.molecule_id\nFROM atom a\nJOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id\nWHERE SUBSTR(a.atom_id, 7, 2) BETWEEN '21' AND '25'\nAND m.label = '+';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects distinct molecule IDs from the `molecule` table that are carcinogenic (indicated by `m.label = '+'`) and are associated with atoms whose IDs have a substring from the 7th to the 8th character between '21' and '25'. The query uses a join between the `atom` and `molecule` tables based on the foreign key relationship `atom.molecule_id = molecule.molecule_id`."
