"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT P.ID)\nFROM Patient P\nJOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID\nWHERE L.TG >= 200\nAND (YEAR(CURRENT_DATE) - YEAR(P.Birthday)) > 50;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct patients who have a triglyceride (TG) level beyond the normal range (TG >= 200) and are older than 50 years. It joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables using the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship. The condition for age is calculated by subtracting the birth year from the current year."
