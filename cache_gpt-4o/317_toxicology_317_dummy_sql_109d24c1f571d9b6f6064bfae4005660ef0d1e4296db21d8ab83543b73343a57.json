"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule WHERE label = '+')) AS percentage\nFROM \n  molecule m\nJOIN \n  atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id\nWHERE \n  m.label = '+' AND a.element = 'cl';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of carcinogenic molecules (those with a label of '+') that contain the Chlorine element ('cl'). It does this by joining the `molecule` and `atom` tables on the `molecule_id`, filtering for carcinogenic molecules and those containing Chlorine, and then calculating the percentage based on the total number of carcinogenic molecules."
