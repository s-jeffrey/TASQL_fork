"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM satscores\nJOIN schools ON satscores.cds = schools.CDSCode\nWHERE satscores.AvgScrMath > 400 AND schools.Virtual = 'F';\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of schools that have an average SAT Math score greater than 400 and are exclusively virtual, as defined by the condition `Virtual = 'F'`. The query joins the `satscores` and `schools` tables using the foreign key relationship between `satscores.cds` and `schools.CDSCode`."
