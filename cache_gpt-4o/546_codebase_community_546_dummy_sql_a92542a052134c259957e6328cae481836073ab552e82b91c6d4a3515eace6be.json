"```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT users.DisplayName\nFROM users\nJOIN posts ON users.Id = posts.OwnerUserId\nWHERE posts.ClosedDate IS NOT NULL;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the distinct display names of users who own posts that are considered \"well-finished,\" as indicated by a non-null `ClosedDate` in the `posts` table. The query uses a join between the `users` and `posts` tables based on the foreign key relationship `posts.OwnerUserId = users.Id`."
