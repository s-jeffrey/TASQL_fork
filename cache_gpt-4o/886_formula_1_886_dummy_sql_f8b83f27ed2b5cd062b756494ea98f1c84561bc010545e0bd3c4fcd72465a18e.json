"```sql\nSELECT year\nFROM races\nGROUP BY year\nORDER BY COUNT(round) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the year with the most number of races by grouping the races by year, counting the number of rounds for each year, and ordering the results in descending order to get the year with the maximum count. The `LIMIT 1` ensures that only the year with the most races is returned."
