"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(fd.id) * 100.0 / COUNT(c.id)) AS percentage\nFROM \n  cards c\nJOIN \n  foreign_data fd ON c.uuid = fd.uuid\nWHERE \n  (c.power IS NULL OR c.power = '*') \n  AND fd.language = 'French';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of cards without power that are in French. It joins the `cards` table with the `foreign_data` table using the `uuid` foreign key relationship, filters for cards where the `power` is either `NULL` or `*`, and where the `language` is 'French'. The percentage is calculated by dividing the count of such French cards by the total count of cards without power, then multiplying by 100."
