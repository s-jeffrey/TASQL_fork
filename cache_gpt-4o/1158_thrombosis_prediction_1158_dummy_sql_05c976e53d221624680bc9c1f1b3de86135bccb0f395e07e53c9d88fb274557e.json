"```sql\nSELECT Patient.ID\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE YEAR(Patient.Birthday) = 1937\nAND Laboratory.T-CHO >= 250;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the IDs of patients who were born in 1937 and whose total cholesterol (`T-CHO`) was beyond the normal range, which is defined as greater than or equal to 250. The query joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables using the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship."
