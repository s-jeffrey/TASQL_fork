"```sql\nSELECT c.CustomerID\nFROM yearmonth ym\nJOIN customers c ON ym.CustomerID = c.CustomerID\nWHERE ym.Date BETWEEN '201201' AND '201212' AND c.Segment = 'LAM'\nORDER BY ym.Consumption ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the `CustomerID` of the customer with the least consumption in the 'LAM' segment for the year 2012. It joins the `yearmonth` table with the `customers` table using the `CustomerID` foreign key relationship, filters the results for the year 2012 and the 'LAM' segment, orders the results by consumption in ascending order, and limits the output to the top result, which corresponds to the least consumption."
