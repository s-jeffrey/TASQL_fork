"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT races.year)\nFROM races\nJOIN circuits ON races.circuitId = circuits.circuitId\nWHERE circuits.name = 'Silverstone Circuit' AND races.name = 'British Grand Prix';\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct seasons (years) in which the Silverstone Circuit hosted the British Grand Prix, which is the race name for the United Kingdom Grand Prix. The query joins the `races` and `circuits` tables using the `circuitId` foreign key relationship and filters the results based on the circuit name and race name."
