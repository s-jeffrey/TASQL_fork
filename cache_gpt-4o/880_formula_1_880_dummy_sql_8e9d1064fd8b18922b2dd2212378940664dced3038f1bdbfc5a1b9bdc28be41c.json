"```sql\nSELECT \n  (r1.fastestLapSpeed - r2.fastestLapSpeed) / r1.fastestLapSpeed * 100 AS percentage_faster\nFROM \n  results r1\nJOIN \n  drivers d ON r1.driverId = d.driverId\nJOIN \n  results r2 ON r2.driverId = d.driverId AND r2.raceId = 854\nWHERE \n  d.forename = 'Paul' AND d.surname = 'di Resta' AND r1.raceId = 853;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage by which Paul di Resta's fastest lap speed in the 853rd race was faster than his fastest lap speed in the 854th race. It uses the `results` table to find the `fastestLapSpeed` for the specified races and the `drivers` table to identify Paul di Resta by his forename and surname."
