"```sql\nSELECT \n  (SUM(CASE WHEN SEX = 'F' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS percentage_of_women\nFROM \n  Patient\nWHERE \n  YEAR(Birthday) = 1980 AND \n  Diagnosis = 'RA';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of female patients who were born in 1980 and diagnosed with RA. It uses the `CASE` statement to count the number of female patients and divides it by the total number of patients meeting the criteria, then multiplies by 100 to get the percentage."
