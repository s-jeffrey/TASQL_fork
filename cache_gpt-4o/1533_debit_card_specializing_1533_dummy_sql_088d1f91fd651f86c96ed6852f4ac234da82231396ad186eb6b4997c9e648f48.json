"```sql\nSELECT y.Consumption\nFROM transactions_1k t\nJOIN yearmonth y ON t.CustomerID = y.CustomerID\nWHERE t.ProductID = 5\n  AND (t.Price / t.Amount) > 29.00\n  AND y.Date = '201208';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the consumption status of customers who paid more than 29.00 per unit for product ID No. 5 in August 2012. It joins the `transactions_1k` table with the `yearmonth` table on the `CustomerID` and filters the results based on the conditions specified in the question and evidence."
