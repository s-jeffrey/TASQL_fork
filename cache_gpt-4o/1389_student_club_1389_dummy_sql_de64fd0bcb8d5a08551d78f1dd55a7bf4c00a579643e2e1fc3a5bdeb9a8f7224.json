"```sql\nSELECT e.event_name\nFROM event e\nJOIN expense ex ON e.event_id = ex.link_to_event\nGROUP BY e.event_name\nORDER BY MIN(ex.cost) ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `event` and `expense` tables using the foreign key relationship between `event_id` and `link_to_event`. It groups the results by `event_name` and orders them by the minimum cost in ascending order, returning the event with the lowest cost."
