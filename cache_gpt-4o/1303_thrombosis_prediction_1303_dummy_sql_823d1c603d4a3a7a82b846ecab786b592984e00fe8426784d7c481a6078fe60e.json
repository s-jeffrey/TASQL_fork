"```sql\nSELECT Birthday\nFROM Patient\nWHERE ID = (\n  SELECT ID\n  FROM Laboratory\n  WHERE GLU > 180\n  ORDER BY Birthday ASC\n  LIMIT 1\n);\n```\n\nThis SQL query finds the birthday of the oldest patient whose blood glucose level is abnormal (GLU > 180). It first identifies the patient with the earliest birthday (oldest) from the Laboratory table where the blood glucose level is greater than 180, and then retrieves the corresponding birthday from the Patient table."
