"```sql\nSELECT satscores.AvgScrWrite, schools.City\nFROM satscores\nJOIN schools ON satscores.cds = schools.CDSCode\nORDER BY satscores.NumGE1500 DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the average writing score (`AvgScrWrite`) and the city (`City`) of the school with the highest number of test takers whose total SAT scores are greater or equal to 1500. It joins the `satscores` table with the `schools` table using the foreign key relationship between `satscores.cds` and `schools.CDSCode`. The results are ordered in descending order by the number of test takers with scores greater or equal to 1500 (`NumGE1500`), and the query limits the result to the top entry."
