"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(fd.id) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(c.id) FROM cards c WHERE c.isStorySpotlight = 1)) AS percentage\nFROM \n  foreign_data fd\nJOIN \n  cards c ON fd.uuid = c.uuid\nWHERE \n  fd.language = 'French' AND c.isStorySpotlight = 1;\n```\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of cards whose language is French among the Story Spotlight cards. It uses a JOIN between the `foreign_data` and `cards` tables based on the `uuid` foreign key relationship, and filters for French language and Story Spotlight cards."
