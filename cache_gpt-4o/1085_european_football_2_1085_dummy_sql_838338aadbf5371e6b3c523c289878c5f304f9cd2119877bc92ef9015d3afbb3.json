"```sql\nSELECT Player.player_name\nFROM Player\nJOIN Player_Attributes ON Player.player_api_id = Player_Attributes.player_api_id\nWHERE Player.player_name IN ('Alexis', 'Ariel Borysiuk', 'Arouna Kone')\nORDER BY Player_Attributes.crossing DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\nThis SQL query selects the player name from the Player table, joining it with the Player_Attributes table to access the crossing attribute. It filters the players to only include Alexis, Ariel Borysiuk, and Arouna Kone, orders them by the crossing score in descending order, and limits the result to the top performer."
