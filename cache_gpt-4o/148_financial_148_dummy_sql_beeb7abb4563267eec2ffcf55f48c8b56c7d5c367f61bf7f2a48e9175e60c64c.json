"```sql\nSELECT account.account_id\nFROM account\nJOIN disp ON account.account_id = disp.account_id\nJOIN client ON disp.client_id = client.client_id\nJOIN district ON account.district_id = district.district_id\nWHERE district.A2 = 'Tabor' AND disp.type = 'OWNER';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the `account_id` from the `account` table for accounts located in the district of Tabor and where the disposition type is 'OWNER', indicating eligibility for loans. The query joins the necessary tables using the foreign key relationships to filter the accounts based on the district name and disposition type."
