"```sql\nSELECT \n    (SUM(e.cost) / COUNT(DISTINCT ev.event_id)) * 100 AS percentage_cost\nFROM \n    event ev\nJOIN \n    budget b ON ev.event_id = b.link_to_event\nJOIN \n    expense e ON b.budget_id = e.link_to_budget\nWHERE \n    ev.type = 'Meeting';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of the cost for events of type 'Meeting'. It joins the `event`, `budget`, and `expense` tables to sum the costs associated with meeting events and divides by the count of distinct meeting events to get the percentage."
