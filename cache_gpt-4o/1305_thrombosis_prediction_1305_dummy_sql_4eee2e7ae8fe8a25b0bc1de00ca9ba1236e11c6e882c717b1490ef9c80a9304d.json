"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Patient.ID)\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Patient.Admission = '+'\nAND Laboratory.WBC BETWEEN 3.5 AND 9.0;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct patients who were admitted to the hospital (indicated by `Admission = '+'`) and have a normal level of white blood cells (WBC between 3.5 and 9.0). The query joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables using the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship."
