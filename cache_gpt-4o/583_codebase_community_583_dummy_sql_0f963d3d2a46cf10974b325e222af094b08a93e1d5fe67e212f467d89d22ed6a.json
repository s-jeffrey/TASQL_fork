"```sql\nSELECT SUM(posts.Score) AS TotalScore, users.WebsiteUrl\nFROM posts\nJOIN users ON posts.LastEditorUserId = users.Id\nWHERE users.DisplayName = 'Yevgeny';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the total score of posts edited by the user with the display name \"Yevgeny\" and includes the user's website URL. It uses a JOIN operation to connect the `posts` and `users` tables based on the `LastEditorUserId` and `Id` columns, respectively. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include posts edited by \"Yevgeny\"."
