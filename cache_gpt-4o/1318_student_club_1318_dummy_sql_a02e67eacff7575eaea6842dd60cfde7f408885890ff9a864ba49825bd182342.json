"```sql\nSELECT event.event_name\nFROM attendance\nJOIN event ON attendance.link_to_event = event.event_id\nGROUP BY event.event_id, event.event_name\nORDER BY COUNT(attendance.link_to_event) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `attendance` table with the `event` table using the foreign key relationship between `attendance.link_to_event` and `event.event_id`. It groups the results by `event.event_id` and `event.event_name`, counts the number of occurrences of each event in the `attendance` table, and orders the results in descending order of attendance count. Finally, it selects the event with the highest attendance by limiting the result to the top entry."
