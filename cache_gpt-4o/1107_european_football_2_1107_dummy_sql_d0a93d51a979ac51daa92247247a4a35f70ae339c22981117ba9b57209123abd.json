"```sql\nSELECT pa.date\nFROM Player_Attributes pa\nJOIN Player p ON pa.player_api_id = p.player_api_id\nWHERE p.player_name = 'Kevin Constant'\nORDER BY pa.crossing DESC, pa.date ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `Player_Attributes` table with the `Player` table to find the date when Kevin Constant had his highest crossing score. It orders the results by the crossing score in descending order and by date in ascending order to ensure that the earliest date with the highest score is selected. The `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the first result is returned."
