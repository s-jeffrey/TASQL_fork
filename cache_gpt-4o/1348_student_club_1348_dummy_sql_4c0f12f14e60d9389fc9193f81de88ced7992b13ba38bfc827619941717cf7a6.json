"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM budget\nJOIN event ON budget.link_to_event = event.event_id\nWHERE event.event_name = 'November Meeting' AND budget.remaining < 0;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of budget entries for the event named \"November Meeting\" where the remaining budget is less than zero, indicating that the cost has exceeded the budget. The query uses a JOIN operation to connect the `budget` table with the `event` table based on the foreign key relationship between `budget.link_to_event` and `event.event_id`."
