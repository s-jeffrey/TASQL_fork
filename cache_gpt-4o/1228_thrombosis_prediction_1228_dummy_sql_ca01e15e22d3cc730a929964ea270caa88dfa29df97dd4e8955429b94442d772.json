"```sql\nSELECT Patient.ID, Patient.Diagnosis\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Laboratory.TG > 300;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the list of patients and their diagnosis from the `Patient` table where the triglyceride (TG) index in the `Laboratory` table is greater than 300, which is 100 above the normal range of less than 200. The query uses a join between the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship."
