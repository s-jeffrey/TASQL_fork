"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Patient.ID)\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Patient.SEX = 'M'\n  AND Laboratory.ALB > 3.5 AND Laboratory.ALB < 5.5\n  AND Laboratory.TP > 6.0 AND Laboratory.TP < 8.5;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct male patients (`Patient.SEX = 'M'`) who have normal levels of both albumin (`ALB > 3.5 AND ALB < 5.5`) and total protein (`TP > 6.0 AND TP < 8.5`). The `JOIN` operation is used to link the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship."
