"To generate the SQL query to answer the question, we need to join the relevant tables based on the foreign key relationships and filter the data according to the conditions specified in the question. Here's how you can construct the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Examination.Symptoms\nFROM Examination\nJOIN Patient ON Examination.ID = Patient.ID\nWHERE Patient.Birthday = '1959-03-01'\n  AND Examination.[Examination Date] = '1993-09-27';\n```\n\nThis query selects the `Symptoms` from the `Examination` table for the patient whose birthday is `1959-03-01` and who had an examination on `1993-09-27`. The `JOIN` operation is used to link the `Examination` and `Patient` tables using the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship."
