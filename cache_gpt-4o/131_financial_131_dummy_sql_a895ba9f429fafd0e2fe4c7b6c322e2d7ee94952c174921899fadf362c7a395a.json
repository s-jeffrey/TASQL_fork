"```sql\nSELECT d.A2 AS district_name\nFROM loan l\nJOIN account a ON l.account_id = a.account_id\nJOIN district d ON a.district_id = d.district_id\nWHERE l.status IN ('C', 'D')\nGROUP BY d.A2\nORDER BY COUNT(l.loan_id) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `loan`, `account`, and `district` tables to find the district with the highest number of active loans. It filters loans with a status of 'C' or 'D', which indicates running contracts, and groups the results by district name. The query then orders the districts by the count of active loans in descending order and limits the result to the top district."
