"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM account\nJOIN disp ON account.account_id = disp.account_id\nWHERE disp.type = 'OWNER' AND account.frequency = 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU';\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of accounts that have an owner disposition and request for a statement to be generated upon a transaction. It uses the `disp` table to filter for accounts with an 'OWNER' disposition type and the `account` table to filter for accounts with a frequency of 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU', which stands for issuance after a transaction."
