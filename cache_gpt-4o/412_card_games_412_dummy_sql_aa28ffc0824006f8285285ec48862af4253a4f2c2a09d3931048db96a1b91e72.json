"```sql\nSELECT fd.name\nFROM cards c\nJOIN foreign_data fd ON c.uuid = fd.uuid\nWHERE fd.language = 'French'\n  AND c.type LIKE '%Creature%'\n  AND c.layout = 'normal'\n  AND c.borderColor = 'black'\n  AND c.artist = 'Matthew D. Wilson';\n```\nThis SQL query selects the foreign name of the card in French, ensuring the card is of type Creature, has a normal layout, a black border color, and is illustrated by Matthew D. Wilson. The query uses the `foreign_data` table to find the foreign name and language, and joins it with the `cards` table using the `uuid` foreign key relationship."
