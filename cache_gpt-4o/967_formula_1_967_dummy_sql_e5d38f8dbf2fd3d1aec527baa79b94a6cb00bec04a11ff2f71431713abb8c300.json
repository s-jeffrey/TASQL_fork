"```sql\nSELECT code\nFROM drivers\nORDER BY dob DESC\nLIMIT 3;\n```\n\nTo determine how many of the top 3 youngest drivers are from the Netherlands, you can extend the query as follows:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM (\n  SELECT code, nationality\n  FROM drivers\n  ORDER BY dob DESC\n  LIMIT 3\n) AS top3\nWHERE nationality = 'Dutch';\n```\n\nThis query first selects the top 3 youngest drivers based on their date of birth and then counts how many of them have the nationality 'Dutch', which refers to the Netherlands."
