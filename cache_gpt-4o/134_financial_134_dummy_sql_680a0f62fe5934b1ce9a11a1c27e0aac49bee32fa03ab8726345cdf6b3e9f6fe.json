"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM account\nJOIN district ON account.district_id = district.district_id\nWHERE district.A16 = (\n    SELECT MAX(A16)\n    FROM district\n);\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of accounts opened in the district where the largest number of crimes were committed in 1996. It uses a subquery to find the maximum number of crimes committed in 1996 (`A16`) and then joins the `account` and `district` tables to filter accounts based on the district with that maximum crime count."
