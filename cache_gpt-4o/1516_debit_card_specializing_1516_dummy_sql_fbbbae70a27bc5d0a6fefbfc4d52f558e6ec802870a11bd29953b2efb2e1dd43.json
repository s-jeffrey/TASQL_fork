"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM transactions_1k t\nJOIN customers c ON t.CustomerID = c.CustomerID\nWHERE t.Date = '2012-08-26'\n  AND t.Time < '13:00:00'\n  AND c.Currency = 'CZK';\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of transactions that were paid in CZK on the morning of August 26, 2012. It joins the `transactions_1k` table with the `customers` table to access the `Currency` column, and filters the results based on the specified date and time conditions."
