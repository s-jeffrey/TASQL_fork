"To answer the question \"How many votes did the user No.58 take on 2010/7/19?\" using the provided database schema, primary keys, and foreign keys, we need to construct an SQL query that counts the number of votes for a specific user on a specific date. Here's how you can write the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM votes \nWHERE UserId = 58 \nAND DATE(CreationDate) = '2010-07-19';\n```\n\nThis query selects the count of votes from the `votes` table where the `UserId` is 58 and the `CreationDate` matches the specified date, '2010-07-19'. The `DATE()` function is used to ensure that only the date part of the `CreationDate` is considered, ignoring the time."
