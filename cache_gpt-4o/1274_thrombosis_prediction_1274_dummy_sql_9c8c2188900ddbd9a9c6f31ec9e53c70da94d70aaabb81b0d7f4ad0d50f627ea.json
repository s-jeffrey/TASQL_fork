"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Examination.ID)\nFROM Examination\nJOIN Laboratory ON Examination.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Laboratory.SSB IN ('negative', '0') AND Examination.Symptoms IS NOT NULL;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct patients who have normal anti-SSB test results (values 'negative' or '0') and have other symptoms recorded in their examination. The query joins the `Examination` and `Laboratory` tables using the patient ID, which is a foreign key relationship."
