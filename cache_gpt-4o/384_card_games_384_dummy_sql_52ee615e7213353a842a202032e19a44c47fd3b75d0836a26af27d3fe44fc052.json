"```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT l.uuid, fd.language\nFROM legalities l\nJOIN foreign_data fd ON l.uuid = fd.uuid\nWHERE l.format = 'legacy';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the unique UUIDs of cards that are legal in the \"legacy\" format and retrieves the foreign languages of these cards from the `foreign_data` table. The query uses a join between the `legalities` and `foreign_data` tables based on the UUID, which is a foreign key relationship."
