"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM account\nJOIN district ON account.district_id = district.district_id\nWHERE district.A2 = 'Jesenik';\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of accounts that are associated with the district named \"Jesenik\". It joins the `account` table with the `district` table using the `district_id` foreign key relationship and filters the results where the district name (`A2`) is \"Jesenik\"."
