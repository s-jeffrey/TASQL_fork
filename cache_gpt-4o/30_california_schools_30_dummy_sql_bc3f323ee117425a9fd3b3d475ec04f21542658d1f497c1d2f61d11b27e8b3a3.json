"```sql\nSELECT s.City\nFROM frpm f\nJOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode\nORDER BY f.`Enrollment (K-12)` ASC\nLIMIT 5;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the cities with the top 5 lowest enrollment numbers for students in grades 1 through 12 by joining the `frpm` table with the `schools` table using the `CDSCode` as the foreign key. The results are ordered by the `Enrollment (K-12)` column in ascending order to get the lowest values."
