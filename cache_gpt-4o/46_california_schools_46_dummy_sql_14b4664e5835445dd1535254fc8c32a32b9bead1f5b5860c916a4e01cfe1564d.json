"```sql\nSELECT s.School, sc.Enrollment\nFROM schools s\nJOIN frpm sc ON s.CDSCode = sc.CDSCode\nWHERE s.DOC = '31'\nORDER BY sc.Enrollment DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the name of the school and its enrollment from grades 1 through 12 for state special schools (where the District Ownership Code, DOC, is 31). It orders the results by enrollment in descending order and limits the output to the top result, which corresponds to the school with the highest number of enrollees."
