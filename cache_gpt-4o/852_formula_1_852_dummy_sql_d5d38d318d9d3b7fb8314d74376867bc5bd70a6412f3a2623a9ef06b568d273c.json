"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM races\nJOIN circuits ON races.circuitId = circuits.circuitId\nWHERE races.year = 2010\nAND circuits.country NOT IN (\n  SELECT DISTINCT country\n  FROM circuits\n  WHERE country IN ('Asia', 'Europe')\n);\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of races held in the year 2010 that took place outside of Asia and Europe. It joins the `races` and `circuits` tables using the `circuitId` foreign key relationship and filters the results based on the year and the country not being in Asia or Europe. Note that the list of countries in Asia and Europe should be specified in the subquery for accurate results."
