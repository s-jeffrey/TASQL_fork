"```sql\nSELECT s.Street, s.City, s.Zip, s.State\nFROM satscores ss\nJOIN schools s ON ss.cds = s.CDSCode\nWHERE ss.NumTstTakr > 0\nORDER BY (ss.NumGE1500 / ss.NumTstTakr) ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `satscores` table with the `schools` table using the foreign key relationship between `satscores.cds` and `schools.CDSCode`. It calculates the excellence rate as `NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr` and orders the results in ascending order to find the school with the lowest excellence rate. The query then selects the `Street`, `City`, `Zip`, and `State` of that school, limiting the result to the top entry."
