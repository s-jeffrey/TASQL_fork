"```sql\nSELECT p.ID\nFROM Patient p\nJOIN Laboratory l ON p.ID = l.ID\nWHERE l.SM NOT IN ('negative', '0')\nORDER BY p.Birthday DESC\nLIMIT 3;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the IDs of the three youngest patients who have an abnormal anti-SM result. It joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables on the `ID` column, filters for patients with `SM` values not in ('negative', '0'), orders the results by `Birthday` in descending order to get the youngest patients, and limits the output to the top three results."
