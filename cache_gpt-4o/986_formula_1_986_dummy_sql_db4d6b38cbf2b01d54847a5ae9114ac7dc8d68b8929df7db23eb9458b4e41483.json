"```sql\nSELECT r.name\nFROM results res\nJOIN races r ON res.raceId = r.raceId\nWHERE res.fastestLap = 1\nORDER BY res.milliseconds ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the name of the race where the fastest first lap time was recorded. It joins the `results` table with the `races` table using the `raceId` foreign key relationship. The query filters for the first lap (`fastestLap = 1`) and orders the results by the `milliseconds` column in ascending order to find the minimum time. The `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the race with the fastest first lap time is returned."
