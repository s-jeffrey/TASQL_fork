"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.ID)\nFROM Patient p\nJOIN Laboratory l ON p.ID = l.ID\nWHERE l.DNA < 8 AND p.Description IS NULL;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of unique patients who have a normal anti-DNA level (less than 8) and whose data are not recorded (Description is NULL). It uses a join between the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship."
