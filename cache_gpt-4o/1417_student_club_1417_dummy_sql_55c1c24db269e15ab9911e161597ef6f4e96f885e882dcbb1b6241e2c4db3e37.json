"```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT e.type\nFROM event e\nJOIN budget b ON e.event_id = b.link_to_event\nWHERE b.remaining > 30;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the distinct types of events from the `event` table that have a remaining budget of more than 30 USD. It joins the `event` table with the `budget` table using the foreign key relationship between `event.event_id` and `budget.link_to_event`, and filters the results based on the condition that the `remaining` column in the `budget` table is greater than 30."
