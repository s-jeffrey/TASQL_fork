"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM comments\nWHERE PostId IN (\n    SELECT Id\n    FROM posts\n    WHERE CommentCount = 1\n) AND Score = 0;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of comments with a score of 0 for posts that have exactly one comment. The subquery selects post IDs from the `posts` table where the `CommentCount` is 1, and the main query counts the comments in the `comments` table with a `Score` of 0 for those post IDs."
