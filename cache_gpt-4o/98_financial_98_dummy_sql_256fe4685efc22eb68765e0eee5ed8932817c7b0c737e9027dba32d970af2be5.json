"```sql\nSELECT account.account_id\nFROM account\nJOIN loan ON account.account_id = loan.account_id\nWHERE loan.date BETWEEN '1997-01-01' AND '1997-12-31'\n  AND account.frequency = 'POPLATEK TYDNE'\n  AND loan.amount = (\n    SELECT MIN(amount)\n    FROM loan\n    WHERE date BETWEEN '1997-01-01' AND '1997-12-31'\n  );\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the `account_id` from the `account` table for accounts that have an approved loan date in 1997, have the lowest approved loan amount, and have chosen a weekly issuance statement (`POPLATEK TYDNE`). The query uses a subquery to find the minimum loan amount for loans approved in 1997."
