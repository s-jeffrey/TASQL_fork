"```sql\nSELECT \n  100.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT L.ID) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT L2.ID) FROM Laboratory L2 WHERE L2.GOT >= 60) AS percentage\nFROM \n  Laboratory L\nJOIN \n  Examination E ON L.ID = E.ID\nWHERE \n  L.GOT >= 60 AND E.Diagnosis = 'SLE';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of patients with an abnormal level of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT >= 60) who are diagnosed with SLE. It uses a JOIN between the Laboratory and Examination tables based on the patient ID, and it filters the results to include only those with a GOT level of 60 or higher and a diagnosis of SLE. The percentage is calculated by dividing the count of such patients by the total count of patients with a GOT level of 60 or higher, and then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage."
