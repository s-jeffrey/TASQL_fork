"To answer the question \"What is the rate of drivers completing all the laps in the 2008 Australian Grand Prix?\" using the provided database schema, we need to:\n\n1. Identify the race ID for the 2008 Australian Grand Prix.\n2. Count the number of drivers who completed all the laps (i.e., those with a non-null time in the results table).\n3. Calculate the total number of drivers who participated in the race.\n4. Compute the rate by dividing the number of drivers who completed all laps by the total number of drivers.\n\nHere's the SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(r1.resultId) * 1.0 / COUNT(r2.resultId)) AS completion_rate\nFROM \n    results r1\nJOIN \n    races ON r1.raceId = races.raceId\nLEFT JOIN \n    results r2 ON r1.raceId = r2.raceId\nWHERE \n    races.year = 2008 \n    AND races.name = 'Australian Grand Prix'\n    AND r1.time IS NOT NULL;\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- We join the `results` table with the `races` table to filter the specific race (2008 Australian Grand Prix).\n- We use a `LEFT JOIN` to ensure we count all participants in the race.\n- We count the number of results where the `time` is not null (indicating the driver completed all laps) and divide it by the total number of participants to get the completion rate."
