"```sql\nSELECT trans.date, trans.amount\nFROM trans\nJOIN disp ON trans.account_id = disp.account_id\nWHERE disp.client_id = 3356\nAND trans.operation = 'VYBER';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the date and amount of all cash withdrawal transactions made by the client with the ID 3356. It joins the `trans` table with the `disp` table using the `account_id` to filter transactions associated with the specified client. The condition `trans.operation = 'VYBER'` ensures that only cash withdrawal transactions are included, as indicated by the evidence."
