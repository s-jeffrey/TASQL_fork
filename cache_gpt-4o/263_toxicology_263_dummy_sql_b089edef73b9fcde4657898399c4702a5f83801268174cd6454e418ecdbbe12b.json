"```sql\nSELECT (SUM(CASE WHEN a.element = 'cl' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(a.atom_id)) * 100 AS percent\nFROM atom a\nJOIN connected c ON a.atom_id = c.atom_id\nJOIN bond b ON c.bond_id = b.bond_id\nWHERE b.bond_type = '-';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of atoms that are chlorine ('cl') among those involved in single bonds ('-'). It joins the `atom`, `connected`, and `bond` tables to filter the relevant data and perform the necessary calculations."
