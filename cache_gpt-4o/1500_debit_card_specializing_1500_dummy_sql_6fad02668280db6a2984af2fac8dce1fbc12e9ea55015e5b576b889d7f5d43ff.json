"```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT p.Description\nFROM yearmonth ym\nJOIN transactions_1k t ON ym.CustomerID = t.CustomerID\nJOIN products p ON t.ProductID = p.ProductID\nWHERE ym.Date = '201309';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the distinct product descriptions from the `products` table for products consumed in September 2013. It joins the `yearmonth` table with the `transactions_1k` table on `CustomerID` and then joins the `transactions_1k` table with the `products` table on `ProductID`. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include records from September 2013, which is represented by the date '201309' in the `yearmonth` table."
