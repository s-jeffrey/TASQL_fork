"To answer the question \"How many accounts in Beroun were opened after 1996?\" using the provided database schema, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant tables: We need information from the `account` and `district` tables.\n2. Use the `district_id` to join these tables, as `account.district_id` is a foreign key referencing `district.district_id`.\n3. Filter the accounts that were opened after 1996. The `date` column in the `account` table is in the format `YYMMDD`, so we need to filter for dates greater than `1996-12-31`.\n4. Filter for the district name \"Beroun\" in the `district` table.\n\nHere's the SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM account\nJOIN district ON account.district_id = district.district_id\nWHERE district.A2 = 'Beroun' AND account.date > '961231';\n```\n\nThis query counts the number of accounts in the district \"Beroun\" that were opened after December 31, 1996."
