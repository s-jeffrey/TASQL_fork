"```sql\nSELECT m.first_name, m.last_name, SUM(e.cost) AS total_cost\nFROM member m\nJOIN expense e ON m.member_id = e.link_to_member\nJOIN event ev ON e.link_to_budget = ev.event_id\nGROUP BY m.member_id\nHAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ev.event_id) > 1\nORDER BY total_cost DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query identifies the member who incurred expenses in more than one event and paid the most amount. It joins the `member` and `expense` tables, groups the results by member, and filters for those who have expenses in more than one distinct event. It then orders the results by the total cost in descending order and limits the output to the top result."
