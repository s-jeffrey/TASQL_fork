"```sql\nSELECT Player.player_name\nFROM Player\nJOIN Player_Attributes ON Player.player_api_id = Player_Attributes.player_api_id\nWHERE Player_Attributes.volleys > 70 AND Player_Attributes.dribbling > 70;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the names of players from the `Player` table whose volley score and dribbling score, as recorded in the `Player_Attributes` table, are both over 70. The query uses a JOIN operation to connect the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables based on the `player_api_id` foreign key relationship."
