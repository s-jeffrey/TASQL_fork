"```sql\nSELECT event.event_name\nFROM event\nJOIN budget ON event.event_id = budget.link_to_event\nORDER BY budget.amount DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `event` and `budget` tables using the foreign key relationship between `event.event_id` and `budget.link_to_event`. It then orders the results by the `amount` column in descending order to find the event with the highest budget amount and limits the result to the top entry."
