"```sql\nSELECT \n    AVG(users.UpVotes) AS average_up_votes,\n    AVG(users.Age) AS average_user_age\nFROM \n    users\nJOIN \n    posts ON users.Id = posts.OwnerUserId\nGROUP BY \n    users.Id\nHAVING \n    COUNT(posts.Id) > 10;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the average number of up votes and the average age of users who have created more than 10 posts. It joins the `users` and `posts` tables on the `OwnerUserId` foreign key, groups the results by user, and filters to include only those users with more than 10 posts."
