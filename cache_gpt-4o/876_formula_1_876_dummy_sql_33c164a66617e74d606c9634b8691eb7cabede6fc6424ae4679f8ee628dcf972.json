"To answer the question about how many drivers did not finish the race on 2015/11/29, we need to query the `results` table to find drivers who have a `time` value that indicates they did not finish. In the context of the `results` table, drivers who did not finish the race typically have a `statusId` that corresponds to a non-finish status in the `status` table. However, since the evidence suggests using the `time` column, we will look for entries where the `time` is not in the format of a finishing time.\n\nHere's the SQL query to find the number of drivers who did not finish the race on 2015/11/29:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM results\nJOIN races ON results.raceId = races.raceId\nWHERE races.date = '2015-11-29' AND results.time IS NULL;\n```\n\nThis query counts the number of entries in the `results` table where the `time` is `NULL`, indicating that the driver did not finish the race, for the race that occurred on 2015-11-29."
