"```sql\nSELECT frameEffects, COUNT(*) AS effect_count\nFROM cards\nWHERE cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL\n  AND cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL\nGROUP BY frameEffects\nORDER BY effect_count DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the most common visual frame effect among the cards that are considered \"incredibly powerful foils\" based on the condition that both `cardKingdomFoilId` and `cardKingdomId` are not null. It groups the results by `frameEffects`, counts the occurrences of each effect, and orders them in descending order to find the most common one."
