"```sql\nSELECT p.Title, c.Text, AVG(p.ViewCount) AS AverageViewCount\nFROM posts p\nJOIN tags t ON t.Id = p.Id\nJOIN comments c ON c.PostId = p.Id\nWHERE t.TagName = 'humor'\nGROUP BY p.Title, c.Text;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the title and comment text of each post tagged as 'humor' and calculates the average view count for those posts. It joins the `posts`, `tags`, and `comments` tables based on the relationships defined in the schema and filters for posts with the 'humor' tag."
