"```sql\nSELECT c.name, c.manaCost\nFROM cards c\nJOIN legalities l ON c.uuid = l.uuid\nWHERE l.format = 'duel'\nORDER BY LENGTH(c.manaCost) DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the names and mana costs of the top 10 cards with the highest unconverted mana cost in the 'duel' format. It joins the `cards` and `legalities` tables using the `uuid` foreign key relationship and orders the results by the length of the `manaCost` string in descending order to find the highest unconverted mana costs."
