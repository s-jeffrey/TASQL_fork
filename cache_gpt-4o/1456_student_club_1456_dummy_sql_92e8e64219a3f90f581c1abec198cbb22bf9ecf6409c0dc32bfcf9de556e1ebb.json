"```sql\nSELECT CONCAT(m.first_name, ' ', m.last_name) AS full_name\nFROM member m\nJOIN expense e ON m.member_id = e.link_to_member\nGROUP BY m.member_id\nORDER BY SUM(e.cost) DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `member` and `expense` tables using the foreign key relationship between `member.member_id` and `expense.link_to_member`. It calculates the total spending for each member by summing the `cost` column in the `expense` table. The results are grouped by `member_id` to ensure each member's total spending is calculated. The query then orders the results in descending order of total spending and limits the output to the top five members. The `CONCAT` function is used to combine the `first_name` and `last_name` columns to form the full name of each member."
