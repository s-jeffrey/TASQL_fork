"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM Patient\nLEFT JOIN Examination ON Patient.ID = Examination.ID\nWHERE Examination.ID IS NULL OR DATEDIFF(Examination.`Examination Date`, Patient.`First Date`) >= 365;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of patients who had not undergone a medical examination until at least a year following their initial hospital visit. It uses a `LEFT JOIN` to include all patients and checks if the examination date is either null (indicating no examination) or at least 365 days after the first date of hospital visit."
