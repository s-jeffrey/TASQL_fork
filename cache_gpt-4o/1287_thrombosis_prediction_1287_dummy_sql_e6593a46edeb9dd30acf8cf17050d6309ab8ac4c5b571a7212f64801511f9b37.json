"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Patient.Admission = '-' AND Laboratory.ALP < 300;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of patients who are followed at the outpatient clinic (indicated by `Admission = '-'`) and have a normal level of alkaliphophatase (indicated by `ALP < 300`). The query joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables using the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship."
