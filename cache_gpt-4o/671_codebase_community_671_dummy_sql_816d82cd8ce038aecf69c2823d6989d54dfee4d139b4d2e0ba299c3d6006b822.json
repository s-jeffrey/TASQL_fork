"```sql\nSELECT u.DisplayName\nFROM badges b\nJOIN users u ON b.UserId = u.Id\nWHERE b.Name = 'Autobiographer'\nORDER BY b.Date ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the display name of the user who acquired the first \"Autobiographer\" badge. It joins the `badges` table with the `users` table using the `UserId` foreign key relationship, filters for the badge named \"Autobiographer\", orders the results by the `Date` column in ascending order to find the earliest date, and limits the result to the first entry."
