"```sql\nSELECT client.client_id, district.A2 AS district_name\nFROM client\nJOIN disp ON client.client_id = disp.client_id\nJOIN account ON disp.account_id = account.account_id\nJOIN district ON client.district_id = district.district_id\nWHERE disp.type = 'OWNER';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the client IDs and their corresponding district names for clients who have the 'OWNER' disposition type, which, according to the evidence, means they have the right to issue permanent orders or apply for loans. The query joins the `client`, `disp`, `account`, and `district` tables to gather the necessary information."
