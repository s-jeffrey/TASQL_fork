"```sql\nSELECT e.event_name\nFROM event e\nJOIN budget b ON e.event_id = b.link_to_event\nWHERE e.status = 'Closed' AND b.remaining < 0\nORDER BY b.remaining ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the name of the closed event whose cost has exceeded the budget the most. It joins the `event` and `budget` tables on the event ID, filters for closed events with a negative remaining budget, and orders the results by the remaining budget in ascending order to find the event with the most exceeded budget."
