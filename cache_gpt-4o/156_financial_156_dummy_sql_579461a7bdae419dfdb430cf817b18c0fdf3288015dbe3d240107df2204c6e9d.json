"```sql\nSELECT client.client_id\nFROM loan\nJOIN disp ON loan.account_id = disp.account_id\nJOIN client ON disp.client_id = client.client_id\nWHERE disp.type = 'OWNER'\nORDER BY loan.amount DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the `client_id` of the owner of the account with the largest loan amount. It joins the `loan`, `disp`, and `client` tables based on the foreign key relationships and filters for the disposition type 'OWNER'. The results are ordered by the loan amount in descending order, and the query returns the top result."
