"```sql\nSELECT AVG(posts.Score) AS AverageScore\nFROM posts\nJOIN users ON posts.OwnerUserId = users.Id\nWHERE users.DisplayName = 'csgillespie';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the average score of posts owned by the user with the display name \"csgillespie\". It joins the `posts` table with the `users` table using the `OwnerUserId` foreign key to match the user ID, and filters the results to only include posts by the specified user."
