"```sql\nSELECT DATEDIFF(badges.Date, users.CreationDate) AS DaysToBadge\nFROM badges\nJOIN users ON badges.UserId = users.Id\nWHERE users.DisplayName = 'Zolomon';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the number of days it took for the user with the display name 'Zolomon' to receive a badge after their account was created. It uses the `DATEDIFF` function to find the difference in days between the `Date` column in the `badges` table and the `CreationDate` column in the `users` table. The `JOIN` operation is used to link the `badges` and `users` tables based on the `UserId` and `Id` columns, respectively."
