"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM Examination\nJOIN Laboratory ON Examination.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Laboratory.GLU < 180 AND Examination.Thrombosis = 0;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of patients who have a normal blood glucose level (GLU < 180) and do not have thrombosis (Thrombosis = 0). It joins the `Examination` and `Laboratory` tables using the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship between these tables."
