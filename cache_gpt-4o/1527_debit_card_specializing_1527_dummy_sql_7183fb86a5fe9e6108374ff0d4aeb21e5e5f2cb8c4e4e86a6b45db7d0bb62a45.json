"To determine which gas station has the highest amount of revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each gas station by summing up the `Amount` from the `transactions_1k` table, grouped by `GasStationID`. Here's the SQL query to achieve that:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    t.GasStationID, \n    SUM(t.Amount) AS TotalRevenue\nFROM \n    transactions_1k t\nGROUP BY \n    t.GasStationID\nORDER BY \n    TotalRevenue DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis query selects the `GasStationID` and calculates the total revenue (`SUM(t.Amount)`) for each gas station. It then orders the results by `TotalRevenue` in descending order and limits the output to the top result, which corresponds to the gas station with the highest revenue."
