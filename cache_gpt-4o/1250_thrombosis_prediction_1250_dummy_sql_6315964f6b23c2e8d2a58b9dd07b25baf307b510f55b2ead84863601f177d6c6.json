"```sql\nSELECT Patient.ID\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Examination ON Patient.ID = Examination.ID\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Laboratory.`U-PRO` > 0 AND Laboratory.`U-PRO` < 30\nAND Examination.Diagnosis = 'SLE';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the patient ID from the Patient table where the patient has a normal proteinuria level (0 < `U-PRO` < 30) and is diagnosed with SLE. The query joins the Patient, Examination, and Laboratory tables using the foreign key relationships to ensure the conditions are checked across the relevant tables."
