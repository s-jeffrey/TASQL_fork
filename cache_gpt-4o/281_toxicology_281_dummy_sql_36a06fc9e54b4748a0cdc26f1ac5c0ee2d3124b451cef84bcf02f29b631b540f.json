"```sql\nSELECT a.element, COUNT(*) AS tally\nFROM atom a\nJOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id\nWHERE m.label = '+'\nAND SUBSTR(a.atom_id, 7, 1) = '4'\nGROUP BY a.element;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `atom` and `molecule` tables to find the elements of the 4th atom in each carcinogenic molecule. It uses the `SUBSTR` function to identify the 4th atom by checking if the 7th character of the `atom_id` is '4'. The query then groups the results by the element and counts the occurrences of each element."
