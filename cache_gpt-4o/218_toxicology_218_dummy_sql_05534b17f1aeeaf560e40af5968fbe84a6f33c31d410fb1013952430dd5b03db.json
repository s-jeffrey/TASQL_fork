"```sql\nSELECT \n  100.0 * (\n    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id)\n    FROM molecule m\n    LEFT JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id\n    WHERE m.label = '+' AND a.element = 'f'\n  ) / COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id) AS percentage\nFROM molecule m\nWHERE m.label = '+';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of carcinogenic molecules (label = '+') that do not contain the element fluorine ('f'). It uses a subquery to count the distinct molecule IDs that are carcinogenic and contain fluorine, and then divides this by the total count of distinct carcinogenic molecule IDs to find the percentage. The result is subtracted from 100 to get the percentage of carcinogenic molecules that do not contain fluorine."
