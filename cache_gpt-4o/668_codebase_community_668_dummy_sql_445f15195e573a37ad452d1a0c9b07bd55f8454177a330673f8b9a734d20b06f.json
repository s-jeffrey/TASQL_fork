"```sql\nSELECT users.DisplayName\nFROM badges\nJOIN users ON badges.UserId = users.Id\nGROUP BY users.DisplayName\nORDER BY COUNT(badges.Name) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `badges` table with the `users` table using the foreign key relationship `badges.UserId = users.Id`. It groups the results by the `DisplayName` of the users and orders them by the count of badges (`COUNT(badges.Name)`) in descending order. The `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the user with the highest number of badges is returned."
