"To generate the SQL query to answer the question \"State the category of events were held at MU 215,\" we need to focus on the `event` table, specifically the `location` and `type` columns. The question asks for the category of events, which corresponds to the `type` column, and specifies the location as 'MU 215'. Here's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT type\nFROM event\nWHERE location = 'MU 215';\n```\n\nThis query selects the `type` of events from the `event` table where the `location` is 'MU 215'."
