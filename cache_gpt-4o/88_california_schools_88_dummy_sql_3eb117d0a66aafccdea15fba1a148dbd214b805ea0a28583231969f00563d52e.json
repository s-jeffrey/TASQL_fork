"```sql\nSELECT s.sname AS SchoolName, sc.AdmEmail1 AS AdministratorEmail\nFROM satscores s\nJOIN schools sc ON s.cds = sc.CDSCode\nWHERE s.NumGE1500 = (\n    SELECT MAX(NumGE1500)\n    FROM satscores\n);\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the name of the school and the administrator's email address for the school with the highest number of test takers who received SAT scores of at least 1500. It joins the `satscores` table with the `schools` table using the foreign key relationship between `satscores.cds` and `schools.CDSCode`. The subquery finds the maximum number of test takers with SAT scores of at least 1500, and the main query retrieves the corresponding school name and administrator's email."
