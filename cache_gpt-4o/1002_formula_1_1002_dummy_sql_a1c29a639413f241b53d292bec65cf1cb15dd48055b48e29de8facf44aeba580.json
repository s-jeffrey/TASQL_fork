"```sql\nSELECT CONCAT(d.forename, ' ', d.surname) AS full_name, d.nationality, r.name AS race_name\nFROM drivers d\nJOIN results res ON d.driverId = res.driverId\nJOIN races r ON res.raceId = r.raceId\nWHERE d.dob = (SELECT MAX(dob) FROM drivers)\nORDER BY r.date ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the full name, nationality, and the name of the first race joined by the youngest racer. It uses the `drivers` table to find the youngest driver by selecting the maximum date of birth (`dob`). It then joins the `results` and `races` tables to find the first race the driver participated in, ordered by the race date."
