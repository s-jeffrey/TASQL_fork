"To answer the question \"Among the posts that were voted by user 1465, what is the id of the most valuable post?\" using the provided database schema, primary keys, foreign keys, and evidence, we need to construct an SQL query that:\n\n1. Identifies posts voted by user 1465.\n2. Determines the post with the maximum `FavoriteCount` among those posts.\n\nHere's the SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT p.Id\nFROM posts p\nJOIN votes v ON p.Id = v.PostId\nWHERE v.UserId = 1465\nORDER BY p.FavoriteCount DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis query performs the following steps:\n- Joins the `posts` table with the `votes` table using the `PostId` foreign key.\n- Filters the results to include only those votes made by user 1465 (`v.UserId = 1465`).\n- Orders the posts by `FavoriteCount` in descending order to find the most valuable post.\n- Limits the result to the top entry to get the post with the highest `FavoriteCount`."
