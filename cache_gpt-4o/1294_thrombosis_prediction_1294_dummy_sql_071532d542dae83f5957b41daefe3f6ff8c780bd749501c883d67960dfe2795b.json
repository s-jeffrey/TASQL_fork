"```sql\nSELECT E.ID\nFROM Examination E\nJOIN Laboratory L ON E.ID = L.ID\nWHERE L.CRE < 1.5\nORDER BY E.aCL_IgA DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the patient's ID from the `Examination` table whose creatinine level is normal (CRE < 1.5) and has the highest anti-Cardiolipin antibody (IgA) concentration. It joins the `Examination` and `Laboratory` tables on the patient ID, filters for normal creatinine levels, orders the results by the `aCL IgA` concentration in descending order, and limits the result to the top entry to find the highest concentration."
