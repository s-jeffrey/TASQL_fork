"```sql\nSELECT AVG(lt.milliseconds) / 1000 AS average_lap_time_seconds\nFROM lapTimes lt\nJOIN drivers d ON lt.driverId = d.driverId\nJOIN races r ON lt.raceId = r.raceId\nWHERE d.forename = 'Lewis' AND d.surname = 'Hamilton'\nAND r.name = 'Malaysian Grand Prix'\nAND r.year = 2009;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the average lap time in seconds for Lewis Hamilton during the 2009 Malaysian Grand Prix. It joins the `lapTimes`, `drivers`, and `races` tables to filter the data based on the driver's full name and the specific race. The average is computed by dividing the total milliseconds by 1000 to convert it to seconds."
