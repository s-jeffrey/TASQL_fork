"```sql\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL AND cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS percentage_incredibly_powerful\nFROM \n    cards\nJOIN \n    sets ON cards.setCode = sets.code\nWHERE \n    sets.name = 'Coldsnap';\n```\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of \"incredibly powerful\" cards in the set \"Coldsnap\". It does this by joining the `cards` and `sets` tables on the `setCode` and `code` columns, respectively, and then filtering for cards where both `cardKingdomFoilId` and `cardKingdomId` are not null, which indicates that the card is considered \"incredibly powerful\". The percentage is calculated by dividing the count of such cards by the total number of cards in the \"Coldsnap\" set and multiplying by 100."
