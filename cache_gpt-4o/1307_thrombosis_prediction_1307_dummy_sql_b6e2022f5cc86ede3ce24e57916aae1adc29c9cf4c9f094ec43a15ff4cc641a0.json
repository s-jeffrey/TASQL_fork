"```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT Patient.ID\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE (Laboratory.RBC <= 3.5 OR Laboratory.RBC >= 6.0)\nAND Patient.Admission = '-';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the distinct patient IDs from the `Patient` table where the patient has an abnormal red blood cell count (either less than or equal to 3.5 or greater than or equal to 6.0) and is followed at the outpatient clinic (indicated by `Admission = '-'`). The query joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables on the `ID` column to access the necessary data from both tables."
