"```sql\nSELECT p.AnswerCount\nFROM posts p\nJOIN users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id\nWHERE u.DisplayName = 'csgillespie'\nORDER BY p.AnswerCount DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the number of answers for the post with the highest number of answers owned by the user with the display name \"csgillespie\". It joins the `posts` table with the `users` table using the `OwnerUserId` and `Id` columns, filters for posts owned by \"csgillespie\", orders the results by `AnswerCount` in descending order, and limits the result to the top entry."
