"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(p.Id) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(Id) FROM posts WHERE YEAR(CreationDate) = 2011)) AS percentage\nFROM \n  posts p\nJOIN \n  users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id\nWHERE \n  YEAR(p.CreationDate) = 2011 AND u.Reputation > 1000;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of posts created in 2011 whose owners had a reputation of over 1000. It uses a `JOIN` between the `posts` and `users` tables to access the reputation of the post owners. The `WHERE` clause filters posts created in 2011 and owned by users with a reputation greater than 1000. The percentage is calculated by dividing the count of such posts by the total number of posts created in 2011, then multiplying by 100."
