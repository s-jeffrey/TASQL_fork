"```sql\nSELECT SUM(CAST(SUBSTRING(manaCost, 2, LENGTH(manaCost) - 2) AS UNSIGNED)) AS total_unconverted_mana\nFROM cards\nWHERE artist = 'Rob Alexander';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the total unconverted mana cost for all cards created by the artist Rob Alexander. It assumes that the `manaCost` column contains values in a format like `{X}{R}{R}`, and it extracts the numeric part for summation. Adjustments might be needed based on the actual format of `manaCost` values in the database."
