"```sql\nSELECT \n  (YEAR(e.\"Examination Date\") - YEAR(p.Birthday)) AS Age,\n  e.Diagnosis\nFROM \n  Examination e\nJOIN \n  Laboratory l ON e.ID = l.ID\nJOIN \n  Patient p ON e.ID = p.ID\nWHERE \n  l.HGB = (\n    SELECT MAX(HGB) \n    FROM Laboratory\n  )\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the age of the patient at the time of the examination by subtracting the year of the patient's birthday from the year of the examination date. It also retrieves the diagnosis from the Examination table. The query joins the Examination, Laboratory, and Patient tables using the patient ID as the foreign key. It filters the results to find the patient with the highest hemoglobin count (HGB) recorded in the Laboratory table."
