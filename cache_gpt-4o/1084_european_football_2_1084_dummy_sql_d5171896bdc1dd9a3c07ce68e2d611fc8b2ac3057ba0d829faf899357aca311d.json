"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT pa.player_api_id)\nFROM Player p\nJOIN Player_Attributes pa ON p.player_api_id = pa.player_api_id\nWHERE strftime('%Y', p.birthday) < '1986'\nAND pa.defensive_work_rate = 'high';\n```\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct players who were born before 1986 and have a high defensive work rate, meaning they would remain in their position and defend while the team attacks."
