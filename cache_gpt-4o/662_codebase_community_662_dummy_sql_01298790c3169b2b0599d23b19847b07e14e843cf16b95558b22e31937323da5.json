"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT posts.Id)\nFROM posts\nJOIN votes ON posts.Id = votes.PostId\nWHERE YEAR(votes.CreationDate) = 2011\nAND votes.BountyAmount = 50;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct posts that have votes created in the year 2011 with a bounty amount of 50. It uses a join between the `posts` and `votes` tables based on the foreign key relationship `votes.PostId = posts.Id`. The conditions in the `WHERE` clause ensure that only votes from 2011 with a bounty of 50 are considered."
