"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT t.account_id)\nFROM trans t\nJOIN account a ON t.account_id = a.account_id\nJOIN disp d ON a.account_id = d.account_id\nJOIN card c ON d.disp_id = c.disp_id\nWHERE t.operation = 'VYBER KARTOU'\n  AND a.frequency = 'POPLATEK MESICNE'\n  AND t.balance < 0;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct accounts that have a negative balance after a credit card withdrawal and have a monthly issuance frequency. It joins the `trans`, `account`, `disp`, and `card` tables to ensure that the transactions are related to credit card withdrawals and that the accounts have the specified frequency."
