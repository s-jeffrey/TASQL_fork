"```sql\nSELECT u.Id, u.DisplayName\nFROM users u\nJOIN posts p ON u.Id = p.OwnerUserId\nJOIN postHistory ph ON p.Id = ph.PostId\nWHERE p.ViewCount >= 1000\nGROUP BY u.Id, u.DisplayName, ph.PostId\nHAVING COUNT(ph.Id) = 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects users who have only one post history entry per post and whose posts have at least 1000 views. It joins the `users`, `posts`, and `postHistory` tables, groups the results by user and post, and filters to ensure each post has exactly one history entry."
