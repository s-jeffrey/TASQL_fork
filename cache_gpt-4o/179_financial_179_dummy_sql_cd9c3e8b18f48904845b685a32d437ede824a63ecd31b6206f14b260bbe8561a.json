"```sql\nSELECT SUM(t.amount) \nFROM trans t\nJOIN disp d ON t.account_id = d.account_id\nWHERE d.client_id = 617 \nAND t.date BETWEEN '1998-01-01' AND '1998-12-31';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the total amount paid by client number 617 for all transactions in the year 1998. It joins the `trans` table with the `disp` table using the `account_id` to find transactions associated with the client and filters the transactions to those that occurred in 1998."
