"```sql\nSELECT Laboratory.PLT\nFROM Laboratory\nJOIN Examination ON Laboratory.ID = Examination.ID\nWHERE Laboratory.PLT > 100 AND Laboratory.PLT < 400\nAND Examination.Diagnosis = 'MCTD';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the platelet level (PLT) from the Laboratory table for patients whose platelet level is within the normal range (greater than 100 and less than 400) and who are diagnosed with MCTD. The query joins the Laboratory and Examination tables using the patient ID to ensure that the diagnosis is correctly matched to the laboratory results."
