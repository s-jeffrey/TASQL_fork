"```sql\nSELECT s.Phone, s.Ext\nFROM satscores ss\nJOIN schools s ON ss.cds = s.CDSCode\nORDER BY ss.AvgScrWrite DESC\nLIMIT 1 OFFSET 332;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `satscores` table with the `schools` table using the foreign key relationship between `satscores.cds` and `schools.CDSCode`. It orders the results by the average writing score in descending order and retrieves the phone number and extension of the school with the 333rd highest average writing score. The `LIMIT 1 OFFSET 332` clause is used to skip the first 332 records and select the next one, which corresponds to the 333rd highest score."
