"```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT g.ChainID\nFROM transactions_1k t\nJOIN gasstations g ON t.GasStationID = g.GasStationID\nJOIN customers c ON t.CustomerID = c.CustomerID\nWHERE c.Currency = 'EUR';\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the distinct ChainIDs of gas stations that have transactions involving customers whose accounts are in euros. It joins the `transactions_1k` table with the `gasstations` and `customers` tables to filter based on the currency condition."
