"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(DISTINCT u.Id) FILTER (WHERE u.Age BETWEEN 13 AND 18) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT u.Id)) AS TeenagerPercentage\nFROM \n  badges b\nJOIN \n  users u ON b.UserId = u.Id\nWHERE \n  b.Name = 'Organizer';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of users who are teenagers among those who have obtained the \"Organizer\" badge. It uses a `JOIN` to connect the `badges` and `users` tables based on the `UserId`, and applies a filter to count only those users whose age is between 13 and 18. The percentage is calculated by dividing the count of teenage users by the total count of users with the \"Organizer\" badge, and then multiplying by 100."
