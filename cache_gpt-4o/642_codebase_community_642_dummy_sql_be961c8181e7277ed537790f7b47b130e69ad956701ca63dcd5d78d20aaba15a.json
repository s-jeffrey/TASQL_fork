"To answer the question \"How many posts were created on 21st July, 2010?\" using the provided database schema, primary keys, and foreign keys, we need to focus on the `posts` table and its `CreationDate` column. The evidence suggests filtering the `CreationDate` to the specific date range for 21st July, 2010. Here's the SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM posts \nWHERE CreationDate BETWEEN '2010-07-21 00:00:00' AND '2010-07-21 23:59:59';\n```\n\nThis query counts the number of posts created on 21st July, 2010, by filtering the `CreationDate` to the specified date range."
