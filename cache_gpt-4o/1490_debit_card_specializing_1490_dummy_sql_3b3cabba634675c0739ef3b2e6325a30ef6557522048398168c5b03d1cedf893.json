"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(DISTINCT y.CustomerID) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.CustomerID) FROM customers c WHERE c.Segment = 'LAM')) AS percentage\nFROM \n  yearmonth y\nJOIN \n  customers c ON y.CustomerID = c.CustomerID\nWHERE \n  c.Segment = 'LAM' AND y.Consumption > 46.73;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of LAM customers who consumed more than 46.73. It does this by counting the distinct LAM customers in the `yearmonth` table with a consumption greater than 46.73 and dividing it by the total number of LAM customers in the `customers` table, then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage."
