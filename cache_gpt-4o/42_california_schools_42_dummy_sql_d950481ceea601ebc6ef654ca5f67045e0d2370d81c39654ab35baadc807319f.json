"```sql\nSELECT schools.EdOpsName\nFROM satscores\nJOIN schools ON satscores.cds = schools.CDSCode\nORDER BY satscores.AvgScrMath DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the type of education offered (`EdOpsName`) from the `schools` table for the school that scored the highest average in Math (`AvgScrMath`) from the `satscores` table. It uses a JOIN operation to connect the `satscores` and `schools` tables based on the foreign key relationship between `satscores.cds` and `schools.CDSCode`. The results are ordered in descending order by the average Math score, and the query returns the top result with `LIMIT 1`."
