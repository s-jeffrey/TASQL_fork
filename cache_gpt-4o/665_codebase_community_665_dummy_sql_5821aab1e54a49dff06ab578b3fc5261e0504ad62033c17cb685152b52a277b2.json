"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(pl.Id) / 12 AS AverageMonthlyLinks\nFROM postLinks pl\nJOIN posts p ON pl.PostId = p.Id\nWHERE YEAR(pl.CreationDate) = 2010 AND p.AnswerCount <= 2;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the average monthly number of links created in 2010 for posts that have no more than 2 answers. It joins the `postLinks` table with the `posts` table using the `PostId` foreign key relationship, filters the results for the year 2010 and posts with an `AnswerCount` of 2 or less, and then divides the total count by 12 to get the average per month."
