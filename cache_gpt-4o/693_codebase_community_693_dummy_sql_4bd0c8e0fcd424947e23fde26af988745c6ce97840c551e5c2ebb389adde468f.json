"```sql\nSELECT \n    u.Id AS UserId,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT p.Id) AS NumberOfPosts,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT c.Id) AS NumberOfComments\nFROM \n    users u\nLEFT JOIN \n    posts p ON u.Id = p.OwnerUserId\nLEFT JOIN \n    comments c ON u.Id = c.UserId\nWHERE \n    u.CreationDate = (SELECT MAX(CreationDate) FROM users)\nGROUP BY \n    u.Id;\n```\n\nThis SQL query identifies the number of posts and comments left by the user who has the latest created user account. It uses a subquery to find the maximum `CreationDate` from the `users` table to identify the latest user. Then, it joins the `posts` and `comments` tables to count the distinct posts and comments associated with that user."
