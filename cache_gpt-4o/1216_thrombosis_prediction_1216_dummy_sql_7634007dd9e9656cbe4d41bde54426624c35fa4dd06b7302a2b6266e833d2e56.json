"```sql\nSELECT Patient.ID, Patient.Birthday\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Patient.SEX = 'M' AND (Laboratory.ALB <= 3.5 OR Laboratory.ALB >= 5.5)\nORDER BY Patient.Birthday DESC;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the patient ID and birthday from the `Patient` table, joining it with the `Laboratory` table to filter male patients (`SEX = 'M'`) whose albumin levels (`ALB`) are not within the normal range (<= 3.5 or >= 5.5). The results are sorted in descending order by the patient's birthday."
