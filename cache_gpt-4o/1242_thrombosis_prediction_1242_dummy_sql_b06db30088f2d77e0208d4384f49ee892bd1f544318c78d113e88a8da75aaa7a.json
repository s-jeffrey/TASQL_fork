"```sql\nSELECT Patient.ID\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE YEAR(Laboratory.Date) = 1984\n  AND (YEAR(CURRENT_DATE) - YEAR(Patient.Birthday)) < 50\n  AND Laboratory.PLT BETWEEN 100 AND 400;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the IDs of patients who had laboratory examinations in 1984, are below 50 years old, and have normal platelet levels (between 100 and 400). The query joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables using the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship."
