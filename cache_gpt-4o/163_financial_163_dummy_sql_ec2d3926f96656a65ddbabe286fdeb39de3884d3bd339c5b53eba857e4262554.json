"```sql\nSELECT d.A2 AS district_name\nFROM loan l\nJOIN account a ON l.account_id = a.account_id\nJOIN client c ON a.account_id = c.client_id\nJOIN district d ON c.district_id = d.district_id\nWHERE l.status = 'A'\nGROUP BY d.A2\nORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `loan`, `account`, `client`, and `district` tables to find the district with the most accounts that have loan contracts finished with no problems (status 'A'). It groups the results by district name and orders them by the count of such accounts in descending order, returning the top result."
