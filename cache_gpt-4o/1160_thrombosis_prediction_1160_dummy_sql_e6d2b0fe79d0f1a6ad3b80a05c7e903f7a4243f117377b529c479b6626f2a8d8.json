"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(DISTINCT L.ID) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT P.ID)) AS percentage\nFROM \n  Patient P\nJOIN \n  Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID\nWHERE \n  P.SEX = 'F' AND (L.TP < 6.0 OR L.TP > 8.5);\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of female patients whose total protein (TP) levels are not within the normal range. It joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables on the `ID` column, filters for female patients (`SEX = 'F'`), and checks if the TP level is outside the normal range (`TP < 6.0` or `TP > 8.5`). The result is the count of distinct female patients with abnormal TP levels divided by the total count of distinct female patients, multiplied by 100 to get the percentage."
