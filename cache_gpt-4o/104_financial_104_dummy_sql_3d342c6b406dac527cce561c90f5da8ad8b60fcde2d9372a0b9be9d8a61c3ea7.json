"To answer the question \"The transaction of 840 USD happened in 1998/10/14, when was this account opened?\" using the provided database schema, we need to find the account associated with the transaction and then retrieve the account's creation date. Here's how you can construct the SQL query:\n\n1. Identify the transaction with the specified amount and date.\n2. Use the `account_id` from the transaction to find the corresponding account.\n3. Retrieve the `date` from the `account` table, which represents the account's creation date.\n\nHere's the SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT account.date\nFROM trans\nJOIN account ON trans.account_id = account.account_id\nWHERE trans.amount = 840 AND trans.date = '1998-10-14';\n```\n\nThis query joins the `trans` and `account` tables using the `account_id` foreign key relationship, filters the transactions to find the one with the specified amount and date, and selects the account's creation date."
