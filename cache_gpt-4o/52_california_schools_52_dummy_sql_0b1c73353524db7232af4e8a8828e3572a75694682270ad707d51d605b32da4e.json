"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.CDSCode)\nFROM satscores ss\nJOIN schools s ON ss.cds = s.CDSCode\nWHERE (ss.AvgScrRead + ss.AvgScrMath + ss.AvgScrWrite) >= 1500\nAND s.MailCity = 'Lakeport';\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct schools (using their unique `CDSCode`) where the total SAT scores (calculated as the sum of `AvgScrRead`, `AvgScrMath`, and `AvgScrWrite`) are greater than or equal to 1500, and the mailing city of the school is 'Lakeport'. The query joins the `satscores` table with the `schools` table using the foreign key relationship between `satscores.cds` and `schools.CDSCode`."
