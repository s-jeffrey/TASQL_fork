"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM sets\nJOIN set_translations ON sets.code = set_translations.setCode\nWHERE set_translations.language = 'Italian'\n  AND set_translations.translation IS NOT NULL\n  AND sets.baseSetSize < 100;\n```\nThis SQL query counts the number of card sets that have an Italian translation and a base set size of less than 100. It joins the `sets` table with the `set_translations` table using the `setCode` as the foreign key, and applies the necessary filters based on the evidence provided."
