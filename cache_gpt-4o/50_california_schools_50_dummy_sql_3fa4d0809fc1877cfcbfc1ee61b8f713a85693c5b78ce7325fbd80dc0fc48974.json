"```sql\nSELECT s.School, s.Street\nFROM satscores ss\nJOIN schools s ON ss.cds = s.CDSCode\nORDER BY ss.AvgScrMath DESC\nLIMIT 1 OFFSET 6;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the name of the school and its postal street address (using the `Street` column) for the school with the 7th highest average Math score. The query joins the `satscores` table with the `schools` table using the foreign key relationship between `satscores.cds` and `schools.CDSCode`. It orders the results by the average Math score in descending order and uses `LIMIT 1 OFFSET 6` to get the 7th highest score."
