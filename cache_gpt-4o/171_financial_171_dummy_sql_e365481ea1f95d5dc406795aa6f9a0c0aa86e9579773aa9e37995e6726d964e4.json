"```sql\nSELECT \n    SUM(CASE WHEN A3 = 'north Bohemia' THEN A16 ELSE 0 END) - \n    SUM(CASE WHEN A3 = 'east Bohemia' THEN A16 ELSE 0 END) AS crime_difference\nFROM \n    district\nWHERE \n    A3 IN ('north Bohemia', 'east Bohemia');\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the difference in the number of crimes committed in 1996 between the regions of North Bohemia and East Bohemia. It uses the `district` table, specifically the `A3` column for the region and the `A16` column for the number of crimes committed in 1996. The query sums the crimes for each region and then computes the difference."
