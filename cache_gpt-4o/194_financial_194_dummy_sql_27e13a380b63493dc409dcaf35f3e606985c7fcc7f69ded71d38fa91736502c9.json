"```sql\nSELECT client.client_id, \n       YEAR(CURDATE()) - YEAR(client.birth_date) AS age\nFROM client\nJOIN disp ON client.client_id = disp.client_id\nJOIN card ON disp.disp_id = card.disp_id\nWHERE card.type = 'gold' \n  AND disp.type = 'OWNER';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the client IDs and calculates the age of clients who have a high-level credit card (type 'gold') and are eligible for loans (disposition type 'OWNER'). The query joins the `client`, `disp`, and `card` tables based on the foreign key relationships."
