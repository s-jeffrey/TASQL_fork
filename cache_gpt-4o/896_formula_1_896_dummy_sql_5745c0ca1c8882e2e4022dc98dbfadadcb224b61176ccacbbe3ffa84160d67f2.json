"To calculate the percentage of races where Lewis Hamilton did not finish in the first position since 2010, you can use the following SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(CASE WHEN r.position > 1 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS percentage_not_first\nFROM \n    results r\nJOIN \n    drivers d ON r.driverId = d.driverId\nJOIN \n    races ra ON r.raceId = ra.raceId\nWHERE \n    d.surname = 'Hamilton' \n    AND ra.year >= 2010;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Tables and Joins**: The query joins the `results`, `drivers`, and `races` tables to access the necessary information about the driver's surname, race year, and position.\n- **Conditions**: It filters the results to include only those where the driver's surname is 'Hamilton' and the race year is 2010 or later.\n- **Calculation**: It calculates the percentage by counting the number of races where Hamilton's position was greater than 1 and dividing it by the total number of races he participated in since 2010. The result is multiplied by 100 to convert it into a percentage."
