"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(CASE WHEN UA <= 6.5 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS percentage\nFROM \n  Laboratory\nWHERE \n  U_PRO > 0 AND U_PRO < 30;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of patients who have a uric acid level (UA) below or equal to 6.5 among those who have a proteinuria level (U-PRO) within the normal range (greater than 0 and less than 30). The query uses a conditional count to determine how many patients meet the uric acid condition and divides it by the total number of patients meeting the proteinuria condition, then multiplies by 100 to get the percentage."
