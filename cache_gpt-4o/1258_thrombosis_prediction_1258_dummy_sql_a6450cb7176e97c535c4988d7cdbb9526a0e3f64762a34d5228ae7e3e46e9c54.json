"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e.ID)\nFROM Examination e\nJOIN Laboratory l ON e.ID = l.ID\nWHERE l.RA IN ('-', '+-') AND e.KCT = '+';\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct patients who have a normal Rheumatoid Factor (RA) and a positive measure of degree of coagulation (KCT). The query joins the `Examination` and `Laboratory` tables using the patient ID, which is a foreign key relationship. It then filters the results based on the conditions specified in the evidence."
