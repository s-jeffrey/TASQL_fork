"```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT Examination.ID\nFROM Examination\nJOIN Laboratory ON Examination.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Examination.Thrombosis = 0\nAND Laboratory.CPK >= 250;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the distinct patient IDs from the `Examination` table where there is no thrombosis (Thrombosis = 0) and the creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) level is abnormal (CPK >= 250) in the `Laboratory` table. The `JOIN` operation is used to link the `Examination` and `Laboratory` tables based on the patient ID, which is a foreign key relationship."
