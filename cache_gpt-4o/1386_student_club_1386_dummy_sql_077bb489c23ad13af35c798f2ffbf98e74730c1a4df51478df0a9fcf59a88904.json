"```sql\nSELECT SUM(e.cost) AS total_expense\nFROM event ev\nJOIN expense e ON ev.event_id = e.link_to_event\nWHERE ev.event_name = 'Yearly Kickoff';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the total expense for the event named \"Yearly Kickoff\" by summing up the `cost` from the `expense` table, where the `event_name` in the `event` table matches \"Yearly Kickoff\". The `event` and `expense` tables are joined using the foreign key relationship between `event_id` and `link_to_event`."
