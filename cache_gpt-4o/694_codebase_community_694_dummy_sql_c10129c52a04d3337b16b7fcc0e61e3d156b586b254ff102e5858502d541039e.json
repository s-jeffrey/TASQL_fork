"```sql\nSELECT c.Text, c.UserDisplayName\nFROM comments c\nJOIN posts p ON c.PostId = p.Id\nWHERE p.Title = 'Analysing wind data with R'\nORDER BY c.CreationDate DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the text and user display name of the latest 10 comments on a post with the title 'Analysing wind data with R'. It uses a join between the `comments` and `posts` tables based on the foreign key relationship `comments.PostId = posts.Id`. The results are ordered by the `CreationDate` in descending order to ensure the latest comments are selected, and the `LIMIT 10` clause restricts the output to the 10 most recent comments."
