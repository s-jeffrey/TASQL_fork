"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Patient.ID)\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Patient.SEX = 'F' AND Laboratory.WBC < 3.5;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct female patients (`Patient.SEX = 'F'`) who have a white blood cell count below 3.5 (`Laboratory.WBC < 3.5`). The `JOIN` operation is used to link the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship."
