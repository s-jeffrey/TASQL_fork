"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Patient.ID)\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Examination ON Patient.ID = Examination.ID\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Laboratory.RNP IN ('-', '0')\nAND Patient.Admission = '+';\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct patients who have a normal level of anti-ribonuclear protein (RNP values of '-' or '0') and have been admitted to the hospital (Admission value of '+'). The query joins the `Patient`, `Examination`, and `Laboratory` tables based on the foreign key relationships and applies the necessary conditions to filter the results."
