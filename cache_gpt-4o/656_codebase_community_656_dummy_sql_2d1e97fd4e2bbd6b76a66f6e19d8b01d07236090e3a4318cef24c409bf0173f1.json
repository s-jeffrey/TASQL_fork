"```sql\nSELECT u.DisplayName\nFROM posts p\nJOIN posts parent ON p.ParentId = parent.Id\nJOIN users u ON parent.OwnerUserId = u.Id\nWHERE p.Score = (\n    SELECT MAX(Score)\n    FROM posts\n    WHERE ParentId IS NOT NULL\n);\n```\n\nThis SQL query is designed to find the display name of the owner of the parent post for the child post with the highest score. Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n1. **Join Operations**: \n   - The `posts` table is joined with itself (`parent`) to link child posts with their parent posts using the `ParentId`.\n   - The `users` table is joined to get the display name of the owner of the parent post.\n\n2. **Filtering**:\n   - The subquery `SELECT MAX(Score) FROM posts WHERE ParentId IS NOT NULL` finds the highest score among child posts (posts with a non-null `ParentId`).\n\n3. **Selection**:\n   - The main query selects the `DisplayName` of the user who owns the parent post of the child post with the highest score."
