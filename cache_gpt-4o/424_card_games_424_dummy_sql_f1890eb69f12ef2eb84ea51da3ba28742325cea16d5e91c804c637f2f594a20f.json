"```sql\nSELECT (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE isTextless = 1 AND layout = 'normal')::float / COUNT(*)) * 100 AS proportion_of_textless_normal_layout\nFROM cards;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the proportion of cards that do not have a text box (`isTextless = 1`) and have a normal layout (`layout = 'normal'`) in the `cards` table. It uses a filtered `COUNT` to determine the number of such cards and divides it by the total number of cards to get the proportion, which is then multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage."
