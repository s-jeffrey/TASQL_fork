"```sql\nSELECT (YEAR('1991-10-21') - YEAR(P.Birthday)) AS Age\nFROM Laboratory L\nJOIN Patient P ON L.ID = P.ID\nWHERE L.UA = 8.4 AND L.Date = '1991-10-21';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the age of the patient at the time of the laboratory test by subtracting the year of the patient's birthday from the year of the test date. It joins the `Laboratory` and `Patient` tables using the `ID` column, and filters the results to find the specific test with a uric acid level of 8.4 on the date 1991-10-21."
