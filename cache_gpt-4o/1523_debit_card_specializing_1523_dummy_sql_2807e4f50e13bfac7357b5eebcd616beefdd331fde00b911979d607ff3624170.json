"To answer the question \"Which country was the card owner of No.667467 in?\", we need to determine the country associated with the customer who owns the card with ID 667467. Based on the database schema, the `transactions_1k` table contains the `CardID` and `CustomerID`, and the `customers` table contains the `CustomerID` and `Country`. However, the `customers` table does not have a `Country` column directly; instead, it has a `Currency` column, which might imply the country indirectly. \n\nGiven the schema, we can assume that the `Currency` might be used to infer the country. Here's how you can write the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT c.Currency\nFROM transactions_1k t\nJOIN customers c ON t.CustomerID = c.CustomerID\nWHERE t.CardID = 667467;\n```\n\nThis query joins the `transactions_1k` table with the `customers` table using the `CustomerID` and filters the results to find the `Currency` (which might imply the country) for the card with ID 667467."
