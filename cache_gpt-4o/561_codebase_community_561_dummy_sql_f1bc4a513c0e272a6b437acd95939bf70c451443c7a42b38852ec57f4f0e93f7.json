"```sql\nSELECT posts.Title\nFROM posts\nJOIN comments ON posts.Id = comments.PostId\nWHERE comments.Score = (SELECT MAX(Score) FROM comments);\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the title of the post that received the highest score comment. It uses a subquery to find the maximum score in the `comments` table and then joins the `posts` and `comments` tables to match the post IDs, filtering for the comment with the highest score."
