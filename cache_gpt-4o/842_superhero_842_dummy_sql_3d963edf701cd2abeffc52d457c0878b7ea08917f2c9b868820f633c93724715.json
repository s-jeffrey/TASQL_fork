"```sql\nSELECT AVG(height_cm) AS average_height\nFROM superhero\nJOIN alignment ON superhero.alignment_id = alignment.id\nWHERE alignment.alignment = 'Neutral';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the average height of all superheroes with a neutral alignment. It joins the `superhero` table with the `alignment` table using the foreign key relationship between `superhero.alignment_id` and `alignment.id`, and filters the results to include only those superheroes whose alignment is 'Neutral'."
