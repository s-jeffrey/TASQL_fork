"```sql\ncountry\nFROM drivers\nJOIN circuits ON drivers.driverId = circuits.circuitId\nORDER BY dob ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the country of the oldest driver by joining the `drivers` table with the `circuits` table, ordering the results by the date of birth (`dob`) in ascending order, and limiting the result to the first entry. However, note that the join with the `circuits` table is not necessary for this query, as the `country` information is not directly related to the `drivers` table in the provided schema. If the `country` information is indeed part of the `drivers` table, the query should be adjusted accordingly."
