"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM set_translations\nWHERE setCode IN (\n    SELECT DISTINCT sets.code\n    FROM cards\n    JOIN sets ON cards.setCode = sets.code\n    WHERE cards.name = 'Angel of Mercy'\n);\n```\nThis SQL query counts the number of translations available for the sets that include the card \"Angel of Mercy\". It first identifies the set codes for the card \"Angel of Mercy\" and then counts the translations for those sets in the `set_translations` table."
