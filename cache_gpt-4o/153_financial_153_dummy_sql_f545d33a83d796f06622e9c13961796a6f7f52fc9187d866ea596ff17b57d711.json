"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM card\nJOIN disp ON card.disp_id = disp.disp_id\nJOIN account ON disp.account_id = account.account_id\nWHERE card.type = 'classic' AND disp.type = 'OWNER';\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of 'classic' cards that are eligible for a loan. It joins the `card`, `disp`, and `account` tables using the foreign key relationships and filters the results based on the card type being 'classic' and the disposition type being 'OWNER', as per the provided evidence."
