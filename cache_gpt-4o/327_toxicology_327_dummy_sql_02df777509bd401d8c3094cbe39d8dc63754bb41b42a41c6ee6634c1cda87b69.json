"```sql\nmolecule_id\nFROM atom\nJOIN molecule ON atom.molecule_id = molecule.molecule_id\nWHERE molecule.label = '-'\nGROUP BY molecule_id\nHAVING COUNT(atom_id) > 5;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the `molecule_id` of non-carcinogenic molecules (where `label = '-'`) that consist of more than 5 atoms. It joins the `atom` and `molecule` tables on the `molecule_id`, groups the results by `molecule_id`, and filters the groups to include only those with more than 5 atoms."
