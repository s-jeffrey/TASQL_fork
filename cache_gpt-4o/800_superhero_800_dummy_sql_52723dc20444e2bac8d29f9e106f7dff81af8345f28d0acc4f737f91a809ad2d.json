"```sql\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM superhero)) AS percentage\nFROM \n    superhero\nWHERE \n    eye_colour_id = (SELECT id FROM colour WHERE colour = 'Blue');\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of superheroes with blue eyes. It counts the number of superheroes whose `eye_colour_id` corresponds to the color 'Blue' in the `colour` table and divides it by the total number of superheroes, then multiplies by 100 to get the percentage."
