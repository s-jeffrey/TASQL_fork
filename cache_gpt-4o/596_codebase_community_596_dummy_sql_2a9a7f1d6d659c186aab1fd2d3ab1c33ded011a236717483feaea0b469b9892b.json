"```sql\nSELECT u.DisplayName, b.Name AS BadgeName, COUNT(c.Id) AS CommentCount\nFROM users u\nJOIN comments c ON u.Id = c.UserId\nLEFT JOIN badges b ON u.Id = b.UserId\nGROUP BY u.Id, b.Name\nORDER BY CommentCount DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the display name of the user, the name of the badge, and the count of comments for the user who has posted the most comments. It joins the `users` table with the `comments` table to count the comments per user and then joins with the `badges` table to list the badges of the user. The results are grouped by user and badge, ordered by the number of comments in descending order, and limited to the top user."
