It joins the `loan`, `disp`, and `client` tables to filter for male clients and uses conditional aggregation to sum the loan amounts for each year. The growth rate is then calculated using the formula provided in the evidence. The `NULLIF` function is used to prevent division by zero in case the sum for 1996 is zero."
