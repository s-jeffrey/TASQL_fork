"```sql\nSELECT Laboratory.ID, Laboratory.Date, (TP - 8.5) AS TP_Deviation\nFROM Laboratory\nJOIN Patient ON Laboratory.ID = Patient.ID\nWHERE Patient.SEX = 'F' AND Laboratory.TP > 8.5;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the ID and Date from the Laboratory table, along with the deviation of the total protein (TP) index from the normal range (calculated as TP - 8.5), for all female patients (where SEX = 'F') whose TP value is greater than 8.5. The query joins the Laboratory and Patient tables using the ID column, which is a foreign key relationship."
