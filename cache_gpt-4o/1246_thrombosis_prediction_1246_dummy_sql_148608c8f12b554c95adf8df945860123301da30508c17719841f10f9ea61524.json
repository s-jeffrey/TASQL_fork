"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e.ID)\nFROM Examination e\nJOIN Laboratory l ON e.ID = l.ID\nWHERE l.APTT > 45 AND e.Thrombosis = 0;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct patients who have an abnormal activated partial prothrombin time (APTT > 45) and do not have thrombosis (Thrombosis = 0). The query joins the `Examination` and `Laboratory` tables using the patient ID, which is a foreign key relationship."
