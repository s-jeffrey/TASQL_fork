"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Patient.ID)\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nJOIN Examination ON Patient.ID = Examination.ID\nWHERE Laboratory.RF < 20 AND Examination.Thrombosis = 0;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct patients who have a normal RF value (less than 20) and do not have thrombosis (Thrombosis = 0). It joins the `Patient`, `Laboratory`, and `Examination` tables using the foreign key relationships defined in the schema."
