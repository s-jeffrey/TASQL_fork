"```sql\nSELECT b.budget_id\nFROM budget b\nJOIN expense e ON b.budget_id = e.link_to_budget\nWHERE e.expense_description = 'Water, chips, cookies'\nORDER BY e.cost DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `budget` and `expense` tables using the foreign key relationship between `budget_id` and `link_to_budget`. It filters the expenses to find those with the description 'Water, chips, cookies' and orders the results by the cost in descending order to find the budget that allowed the most money for these items. The `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the budget with the highest cost is returned."
