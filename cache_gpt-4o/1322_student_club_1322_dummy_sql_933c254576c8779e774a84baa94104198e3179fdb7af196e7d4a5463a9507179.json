"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e.event_id)\nFROM event e\nJOIN attendance a ON e.event_id = a.link_to_event\nWHERE e.type = 'Meeting'\nGROUP BY e.event_id\nHAVING COUNT(a.link_to_member) > 10;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of unique events that are of type 'Meeting' and have been attended by more than 10 members. It uses a JOIN between the `event` and `attendance` tables to link events with their attendance records, filters for events of type 'Meeting', and groups the results by event ID to count the number of attendees for each event. The `HAVING` clause ensures that only events with more than 10 attendees are counted."
