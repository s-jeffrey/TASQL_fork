"```sql\nSELECT s.School, (f.\"FRPM Count (K-12)\" / f.\"Enrollment (K-12)\") AS \"Eligible FRPM Rate\"\nFROM frpm f\nJOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode\nWHERE s.SOC = '66'\nORDER BY f.\"FRPM Count (K-12)\" DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the school name and the eligible free or reduced-price meal rate for grades K-12. It joins the `frpm` and `schools` tables on the `CDSCode` column, filters for schools with the ownership code 66, and orders the results by the `FRPM Count (K-12)` in descending order to get the top 5 schools. The eligible FRPM rate is calculated as the `FRPM Count (K-12)` divided by the `Enrollment (K-12)`."
