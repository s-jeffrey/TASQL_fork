"```sql\nSELECT P.ID, P.SEX, P.Birthday\nFROM Patient P\nJOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID\nWHERE L.T-BIL = (SELECT MAX(T-BIL) FROM Laboratory);\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the patient details (ID, sex, and birthday) for the patient(s) with the highest total bilirubin level recorded in the Laboratory table. It uses a subquery to find the maximum value of the `T-BIL` column and then joins the Laboratory and Patient tables on the patient ID to get the corresponding patient details."
