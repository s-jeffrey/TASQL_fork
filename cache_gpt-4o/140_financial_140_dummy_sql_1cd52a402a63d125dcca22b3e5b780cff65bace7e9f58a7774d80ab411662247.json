"To answer the question \"How many accounts are there in the district of 'Pisek'?\" using the provided database schema, we need to join the `account` table with the `district` table using the foreign key relationship and filter by the district name 'Pisek'. Here's the SQL query to achieve that:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM account\nJOIN district ON account.district_id = district.district_id\nWHERE district.A2 = 'Pisek';\n```\n\nThis query counts the number of accounts in the district named 'Pisek' by joining the `account` table with the `district` table on the `district_id` and filtering for the district name 'Pisek' using the `A2` column, which refers to the district name."
