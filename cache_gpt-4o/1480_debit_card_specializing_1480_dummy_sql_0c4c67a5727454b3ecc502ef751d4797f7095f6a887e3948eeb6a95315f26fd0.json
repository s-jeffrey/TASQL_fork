"```sql\nSELECT ym.Date, SUM(ym.Consumption) AS TotalConsumption\nFROM yearmonth ym\nJOIN customers c ON ym.CustomerID = c.CustomerID\nWHERE c.Segment = 'SME' AND ym.Date BETWEEN '201301' AND '201312'\nGROUP BY ym.Date\nORDER BY TotalConsumption DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `yearmonth` table with the `customers` table to filter for SME customers. It then sums the `Consumption` for each month in 2013, orders the results by total consumption in descending order, and selects the month with the highest consumption."
