"To answer the question \"What percentage of bonds have the most common combination of atoms' elements?\" using the provided database schema, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the most common combination of elements in the `atom` table.\n2. Count the number of bonds that involve this combination of elements.\n3. Calculate the percentage of these bonds relative to the total number of bonds.\n\nHere's the SQL query that accomplishes this:\n\n```sql\nWITH ElementCombinations AS (\n    SELECT a1.element AS element1, a2.element AS element2, COUNT(*) AS combination_count\n    FROM connected c\n    JOIN atom a1 ON c.atom_id = a1.atom_id\n    JOIN atom a2 ON c.atom_id2 = a2.atom_id\n    GROUP BY a1.element, a2.element\n    ORDER BY combination_count DESC\n    LIMIT 1\n),\nCommonBonds AS (\n    SELECT b.bond_id\n    FROM bond b\n    JOIN connected c ON b.bond_id = c.bond_id\n    JOIN atom a1 ON c.atom_id = a1.atom_id\n    JOIN atom a2 ON c.atom_id2 = a2.atom_id\n    JOIN ElementCombinations ec ON a1.element = ec.element1 AND a2.element = ec.element2\n)\nSELECT (COUNT(cb.bond_id) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bond)) AS percentage\nFROM CommonBonds cb;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **ElementCombinations CTE**: This common table expression (CTE) calculates the most common combination of elements by joining the `connected` table with the `atom` table twice (once for each atom in the bond) and counting the occurrences of each element pair.\n\n- **CommonBonds CTE**: This CTE identifies all bonds that involve the most common combination of elements found in the `ElementCombinations` CTE.\n\n- **Final SELECT**: The final query calculates the percentage of these common bonds relative to the total number of bonds in the `bond` table."
