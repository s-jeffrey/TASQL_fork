"```sql\nSELECT s.Phone\nFROM satscores ss\nJOIN schools s ON ss.cds = s.CDSCode\nORDER BY ss.NumGE1500 DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the phone number of the school with the highest number of test takers whose total SAT scores are greater or equal to 1500. It joins the `satscores` table with the `schools` table using the foreign key relationship between `satscores.cds` and `schools.CDSCode`. The results are ordered in descending order based on the `NumGE1500` column, and the query limits the output to the top result to get the school with the highest number."
