"```sql\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT connected.atom_id) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT atom.atom_id)) AS percentage\nFROM atom\nJOIN connected ON atom.atom_id = connected.atom_id\nJOIN bond ON connected.bond_id = bond.bond_id\nWHERE bond.bond_type = '-';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of atoms that are involved in single bonds. It joins the `atom`, `connected`, and `bond` tables to filter out the atoms that are part of single bonds (where `bond_type` is `'-'`). It then calculates the percentage by dividing the count of distinct atoms with single bonds by the total count of distinct atoms, and multiplies by 100 to get the percentage."
