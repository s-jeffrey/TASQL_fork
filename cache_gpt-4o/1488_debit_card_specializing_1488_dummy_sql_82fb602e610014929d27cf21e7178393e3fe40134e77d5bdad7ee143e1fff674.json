"```sql\nSELECT c.CustomerID, MAX(y.Consumption) AS MaxConsumption\nFROM customers c\nJOIN yearmonth y ON c.CustomerID = y.CustomerID\nWHERE c.Segment = 'KAM'\nGROUP BY c.CustomerID\nORDER BY MaxConsumption DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `customers` and `yearmonth` tables on the `CustomerID` column, filters for customers in the 'KAM' segment, and then finds the customer with the maximum consumption. It returns the `CustomerID` and the maximum consumption amount for that customer."
