"```sql\nSELECT \n  y1.Consumption - y2.Consumption AS ConsumptionDifference\nFROM \n  yearmonth y1\nJOIN \n  yearmonth y2 ON y1.Date = y2.Date\nWHERE \n  y1.CustomerID = 7 AND y2.CustomerID = 5 AND y1.Date = '201304';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the difference in consumption between customer 7 and customer 5 for April 2013. It uses a self-join on the `yearmonth` table to compare the consumption values for the same date (`201304`), which corresponds to April 2013."
