"```sql\nSELECT drivers.forename, drivers.surname, lapTimes.time\nFROM lapTimes\nJOIN races ON lapTimes.raceId = races.raceId\nJOIN drivers ON lapTimes.driverId = drivers.driverId\nWHERE races.name = 'French Grand Prix' AND lapTimes.lap = 3\nORDER BY lapTimes.time DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the forename and surname of the driver who had the slowest time in the 3rd lap of the French Grand Prix. It joins the `lapTimes`, `races`, and `drivers` tables to get the necessary information and orders the results by the lap time in descending order to find the slowest time."
