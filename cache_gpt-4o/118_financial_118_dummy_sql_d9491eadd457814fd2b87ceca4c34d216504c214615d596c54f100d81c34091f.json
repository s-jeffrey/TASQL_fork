"```sql\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(DISTINCT loan.account_id) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT account.account_id)) AS percentage_running_ok\nFROM \n    loan\nJOIN \n    account ON loan.account_id = account.account_id\nWHERE \n    loan.amount < 100000 AND loan.status = 'C';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of accounts with a loan amount less than USD 100,000 that are still running with no issues (status 'C'). It joins the `loan` and `account` tables on `account_id`, filters for loans with an amount less than 100,000 and status 'C', and then calculates the percentage of such accounts relative to the total number of accounts."
