"```sql\nSELECT c.CustomerID\nFROM customers c\nJOIN yearmonth ym ON c.CustomerID = ym.CustomerID\nWHERE c.Segment = 'LAM'\n  AND c.Currency = 'EUR'\n  AND ym.Date = '201310'\nORDER BY ym.Consumption DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the `CustomerID` of the LAM customer who used the Euro as their currency and had the highest consumption in October 2013. It joins the `customers` and `yearmonth` tables on `CustomerID`, filters for the specified segment and currency, and orders the results by consumption in descending order, returning only the top result."
