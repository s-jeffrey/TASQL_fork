"```sql\nSELECT d.nationality\nFROM results r\nJOIN drivers d ON r.driverId = d.driverId\nWHERE r.raceId = 933\nORDER BY r.fastestLapSpeed DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the nationality of the driver who set the fastest lap speed in race number 933. It joins the `results` table with the `drivers` table using the `driverId` foreign key relationship, orders the results by `fastestLapSpeed` in descending order to get the maximum speed, and limits the output to the top result."
