"```sql\nSELECT d.forename, d.surname, ds.wins\nFROM drivers d\nJOIN driverStandings ds ON d.driverId = ds.driverId\nWHERE d.dob = (SELECT MIN(dob) FROM drivers)\nORDER BY ds.wins DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query finds the full name and the number of wins of the oldest racer by first identifying the driver with the earliest date of birth (`MIN(dob)`). It then joins the `drivers` table with the `driverStandings` table to get the number of wins for that driver. The results are ordered by the number of wins in descending order, and the query returns the top result."
