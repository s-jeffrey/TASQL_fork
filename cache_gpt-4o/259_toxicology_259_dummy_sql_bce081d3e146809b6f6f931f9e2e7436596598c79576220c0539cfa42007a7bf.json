"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a.element)\nFROM molecule m\nJOIN bond b ON m.molecule_id = b.molecule_id\nJOIN connected c ON b.bond_id = c.bond_id\nJOIN atom a ON c.atom_id = a.atom_id\nWHERE b.bond_type = '-' AND m.label = '+';\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the distinct elements present in molecules that have single bonds and are carcinogenic. It joins the necessary tables based on the foreign key relationships and filters the results based on the bond type and molecule label."
