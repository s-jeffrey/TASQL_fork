"```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT d.driverId, d.code\nFROM drivers d\nJOIN results r ON d.driverId = r.driverId\nWHERE YEAR(d.dob) = 1971 AND r.fastestLapTime IS NOT NULL;\n```\nThis SQL query selects the distinct driver IDs and codes of drivers who were born in 1971 and have a recorded fastest lap time in any race. The query joins the `drivers` table with the `results` table using the `driverId` as the foreign key and filters the results based on the year of birth and the presence of a fastest lap time."
