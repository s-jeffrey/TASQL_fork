"```sql\nSELECT client.client_id\nFROM client\nJOIN disp ON client.client_id = disp.client_id\nJOIN loan ON disp.account_id = loan.account_id\nWHERE client.gender = 'F'\nORDER BY loan.amount DESC\nLIMIT 3;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `client`, `disp`, and `loan` tables to find the IDs of the three female clients with the largest loan amounts. It filters for female clients using the `gender` column and orders the results by the `amount` column in descending order to get the largest loans. The `LIMIT 3` clause ensures that only the top three results are returned."
