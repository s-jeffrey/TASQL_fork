"```sql\nSELECT AVG(t.Price * t.Amount) AS average_total_price\nFROM transactions_1k t\nJOIN customers c ON t.CustomerID = c.CustomerID\nWHERE c.Currency = 'EUR';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the average total price of transactions for customers who paid in euros. It joins the `transactions_1k` table with the `customers` table on the `CustomerID` and filters the results to include only those customers whose currency is 'EUR'. The total price for each transaction is calculated by multiplying the `Price` by the `Amount`, and the average of these total prices is returned."
