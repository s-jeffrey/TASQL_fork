"```sql\nSELECT E.ID\nFROM Examination E\nJOIN Laboratory L ON E.ID = L.ID\nWHERE (L.HCT <= 29 OR L.HCT >= 52)\nORDER BY E.`aCL IgA` DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the ID of the patient with the highest anti-Cardiolipin antibody concentration (aCL IgA) among those whose Hematoclit (HCT) level is not within the normal range (29 < N < 52). The query joins the Examination and Laboratory tables using the patient ID, filters for abnormal Hematoclit levels, and orders the results by aCL IgA in descending order to find the maximum value. The `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the patient with the highest concentration is returned."
