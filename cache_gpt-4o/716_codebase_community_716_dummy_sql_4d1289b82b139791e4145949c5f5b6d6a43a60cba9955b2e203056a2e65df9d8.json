"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(DISTINCT c.UserId) FILTER (WHERE u.UpVotes = 0) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT c.UserId)) AS percentage\nFROM \n  comments c\nJOIN \n  users u ON c.UserId = u.Id\nWHERE \n  c.Score BETWEEN 5 AND 10;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of users who have 0 upvotes among those who have made comments with scores between 5 and 10. It uses a `JOIN` to connect the `comments` and `users` tables based on the `UserId`, and applies a filter to count only those users with 0 upvotes."
