"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT d.driverId)\nFROM results r\nJOIN drivers d ON r.driverId = d.driverId\nJOIN races ra ON r.raceId = ra.raceId\nWHERE ra.name = 'Chinese Grand Prix' \n  AND ra.year = 2008\n  AND r.time IS NOT NULL\n  AND (SELECT COUNT(r2.raceId) FROM results r2 WHERE r2.driverId = d.driverId) > 0;\n```\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct drivers who finished the race in the 2008 Chinese Grand Prix and have participated in Formula 1 races. It uses the `results`, `drivers`, and `races` tables, ensuring that the `time` column in the `results` table is not null to confirm that the driver finished the race. The subquery checks that the driver has participated in at least one race."
