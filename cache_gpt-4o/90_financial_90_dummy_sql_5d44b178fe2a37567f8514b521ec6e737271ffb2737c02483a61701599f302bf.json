"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT account.account_id)\nFROM account\nJOIN disp ON account.account_id = disp.account_id\nJOIN client ON disp.client_id = client.client_id\nJOIN district ON client.district_id = district.district_id\nWHERE district.A3 = 'Prague'\nAND account.account_id IN (\n    SELECT loan.account_id\n    FROM loan\n);\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct accounts that are eligible for loans and are located in the region of Prague. It joins the necessary tables based on the foreign key relationships and filters the results to include only those accounts associated with clients in the Prague region. It also ensures that the accounts are eligible for loans by checking their presence in the loan table."
