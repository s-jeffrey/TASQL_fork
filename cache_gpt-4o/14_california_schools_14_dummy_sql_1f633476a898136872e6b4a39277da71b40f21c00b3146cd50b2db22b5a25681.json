"```sql\nSELECT s.NCESSchool\nFROM frpm f\nJOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode\nORDER BY f.`Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the NCES school identification number (`NCESSchool`) from the `schools` table, joining it with the `frpm` table using the `CDSCode` as the foreign key. It orders the results by the `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` column in descending order and limits the output to the top five schools."
