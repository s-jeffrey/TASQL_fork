"```sql\nSELECT s.School, s.Latitude, f.SchoolType\nFROM schools s\nJOIN frpm f ON s.CDSCode = f.CDSCode\nWHERE s.Latitude = (SELECT MAX(Latitude) FROM schools);\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the name of the school, its latitude, and the school type for the school with the highest latitude. It joins the `schools` and `frpm` tables using the `CDSCode` as the foreign key. The subquery finds the maximum latitude from the `schools` table to identify the school with the highest latitude."
