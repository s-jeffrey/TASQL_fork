"```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT Patient.Diagnosis\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Laboratory.TP < 6.0;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the distinct diagnoses of patients whose total protein (TP) level is lower than the normal range, which is less than 6.0. The query joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables using the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship between these tables."
