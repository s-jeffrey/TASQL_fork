"```sql\nSELECT DATEDIFF(e.`Examination Date`, p.`First Date`) AS days_between\nFROM Examination e\nJOIN Patient p ON e.ID = p.ID\nWHERE p.ID = 821298;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the number of days between the first hospital visit and the examination date for the patient with ID 821298. It uses the `DATEDIFF` function to compute the difference between the `Examination Date` from the `Examination` table and the `First Date` from the `Patient` table. The query joins the `Examination` and `Patient` tables on the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship."
