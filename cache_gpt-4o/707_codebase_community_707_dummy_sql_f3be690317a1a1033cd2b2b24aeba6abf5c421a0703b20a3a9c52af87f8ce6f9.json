"```sql\nSELECT c.Text\nFROM posts p\nJOIN comments c ON p.Id = c.PostId\nWHERE p.ViewCount BETWEEN 100 AND 150\nORDER BY c.Score DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the `Text` of the comment with the highest score among posts that have a `ViewCount` between 100 and 150. It joins the `posts` and `comments` tables on the `PostId` and orders the results by `Score` in descending order, returning only the top result."
