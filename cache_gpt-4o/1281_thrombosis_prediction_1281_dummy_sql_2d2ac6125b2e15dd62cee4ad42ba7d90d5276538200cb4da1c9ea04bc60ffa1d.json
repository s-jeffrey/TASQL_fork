"```sql\nSELECT MAX(Birthday)\nFROM Patient\nWHERE ID IN (\n    SELECT ID\n    FROM Laboratory\n    WHERE GOT >= 60\n);\n```\n\nThis SQL query finds the birthdate of the youngest patient among those who have an abnormal level of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT >= 60). It does this by selecting the maximum birthday value from the `Patient` table for patients whose IDs are found in the `Laboratory` table with a GOT value of 60 or higher."
