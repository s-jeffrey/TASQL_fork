"```sql\nSELECT r.name AS race, r.year\nFROM results res\nJOIN drivers d ON res.driverId = d.driverId\nJOIN races r ON res.raceId = r.raceId\nWHERE d.forename = 'Michael' AND d.surname = 'Schumacher'\nORDER BY res.milliseconds ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the race name and year from the `races` table where Michael Schumacher had his fastest lap. It joins the `results`, `drivers`, and `races` tables, filters for Michael Schumacher, and orders by the `milliseconds` column to find the fastest lap."
