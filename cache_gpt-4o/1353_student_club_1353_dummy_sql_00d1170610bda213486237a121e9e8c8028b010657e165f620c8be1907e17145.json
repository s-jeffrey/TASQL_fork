"```sql\nSELECT z.type\nFROM member m\nJOIN zip_code z ON m.zip = z.zip_code\nWHERE m.first_name = 'Christof' AND m.last_name = 'Nielson';\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `member` table with the `zip_code` table using the `zip` column from the `member` table and the `zip_code` column from the `zip_code` table. It filters the results to find the member with the first name \"Christof\" and the last name \"Nielson\" and selects the `type` of the zip code associated with that member."
