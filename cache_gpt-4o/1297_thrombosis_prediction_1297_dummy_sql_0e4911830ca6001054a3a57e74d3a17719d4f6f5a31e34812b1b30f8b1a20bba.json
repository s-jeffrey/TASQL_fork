"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Examination.ID)\nFROM Examination\nJOIN Laboratory ON Examination.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Laboratory.T-CHO >= 250 AND Examination.KCT = '-';\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct patients (using their `ID`) who have a total cholesterol (`T-CHO`) level higher than or equal to 250 and a negative measure of degree of coagulation (`KCT = '-'`). The query joins the `Examination` and `Laboratory` tables on the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship."
