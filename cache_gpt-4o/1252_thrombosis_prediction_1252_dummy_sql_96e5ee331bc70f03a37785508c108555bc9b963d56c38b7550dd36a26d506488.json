"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Examination.ID)\nFROM Examination\nJOIN Laboratory ON Examination.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Laboratory.IGG > 900 AND Laboratory.IGG < 2000\nAND Examination.Symptoms IS NOT NULL;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct patients who have a normal Ig G level and have recorded symptoms. It joins the `Examination` and `Laboratory` tables using the patient ID, checks for the normal Ig G level condition, and ensures that the `Symptoms` column is not null."
