"```sql\nSELECT strftime('%Y', t.Date) AS Year, SUM(t.Amount) AS TotalGasUse\nFROM transactions_1k t\nJOIN customers c ON t.CustomerID = c.CustomerID\nJOIN products p ON t.ProductID = p.ProductID\nWHERE c.Currency = 'EUR' AND p.Description LIKE '%gas%'\nGROUP BY Year\nORDER BY TotalGasUse DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query assumes that the product descriptions related to gas use contain the word \"gas\". If the actual product descriptions for gas use are different, you would need to adjust the `WHERE` clause accordingly."
