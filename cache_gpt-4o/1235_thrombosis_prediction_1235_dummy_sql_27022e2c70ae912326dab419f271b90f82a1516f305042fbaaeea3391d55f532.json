"```sql\nSELECT Patient.ID, \n       Patient.Diagnosis, \n       YEAR(CURRENT_DATE) - YEAR(Patient.Birthday) AS Age\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Laboratory.RBC < 3.5;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the patient ID, diagnosis, and age for patients who have a red blood cell count (RBC) lower than 3.5. It calculates the age by subtracting the birth year from the current year. The query joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables using the patient ID, which is a foreign key relationship."
