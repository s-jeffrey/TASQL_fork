"```sql\nSELECT SUM(results.points) AS total_points\nFROM results\nJOIN drivers ON results.driverId = drivers.driverId\nWHERE drivers.forename = 'Lewis' AND drivers.surname = 'Hamilton';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the total points Lewis Hamilton has earned in all the Formula 1 races he participated in. It joins the `results` table with the `drivers` table using the `driverId` foreign key to filter the results for Lewis Hamilton by matching his forename and surname. The `SUM` function is used to aggregate the points he earned across all races."
