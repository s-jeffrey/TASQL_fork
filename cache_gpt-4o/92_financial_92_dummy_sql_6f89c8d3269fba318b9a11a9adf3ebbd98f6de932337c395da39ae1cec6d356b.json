"To answer the question about the number of districts where the average salary for females is more than 6000 but less than 10000, we need to consider the database schema and the evidence provided. The evidence indicates that A11 refers to the average salary, and we need to filter based on gender being 'F'. However, the schema provided does not explicitly mention a column for female average salary. Assuming that the average salary (A11) can be filtered by gender, we can proceed with the SQL query.\n\nHere's how you can construct the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT district.district_id)\nFROM district\nJOIN client ON district.district_id = client.district_id\nWHERE client.gender = 'F'\nAND district.A11 > 6000\nAND district.A11 < 10000;\n```\n\nThis query joins the `district` and `client` tables on the `district_id` and filters for female clients (`gender = 'F'`). It then checks if the average salary (`A11`) is between 6000 and 10000. Finally, it counts the distinct number of districts that meet these criteria."
