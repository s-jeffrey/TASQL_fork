"```sql\nSELECT account.account_id\nFROM account\nJOIN loan ON account.account_id = loan.account_id\nWHERE loan.duration > 24\nAND loan.amount = (\n    SELECT MIN(amount)\n    FROM loan\n    WHERE duration > 24\n)\nAND account.date < '1997-01-01';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the `account_id` from the `account` table for accounts that have a loan duration of more than 24 months, the lowest approved loan amount, and an account opening date before 1997. The query uses a subquery to find the minimum loan amount among loans with a duration greater than 24 months."
