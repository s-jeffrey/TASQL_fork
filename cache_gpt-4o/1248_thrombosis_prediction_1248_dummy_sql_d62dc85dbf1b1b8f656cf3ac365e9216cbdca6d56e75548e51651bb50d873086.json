"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Patient.ID)\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Patient.Birthday > '1980-01-01'\nAND (Laboratory.FG < 150 OR Laboratory.FG > 450);\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct patients who were born after January 1, 1980, and have an abnormal fibrinogen level, which is defined as a level outside the range of 150 to 450. The query joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables using the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship."
