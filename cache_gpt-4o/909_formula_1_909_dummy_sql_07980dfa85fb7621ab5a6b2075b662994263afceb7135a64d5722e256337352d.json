"```sql\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE circuits.country = 'Germany')::float / COUNT(*)) * 100 AS percentage\nFROM \n    races\nJOIN \n    circuits ON races.circuitId = circuits.circuitId\nWHERE \n    races.name = 'European Grand Prix';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of European Grand Prix races that were hosted in Germany. It joins the `races` and `circuits` tables using the `circuitId` foreign key to access the country information for each race. The query filters the races to only include those named 'European Grand Prix' and calculates the percentage of these races that took place in Germany."
