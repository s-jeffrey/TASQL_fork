"```sql\nSELECT r.name AS race_name, r.year, c.location\nFROM races r\nJOIN results res ON r.raceId = res.raceId\nJOIN circuits c ON r.circuitId = c.circuitId\nWHERE res.laps = (\n    SELECT MAX(laps)\n    FROM results\n);\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the name of the race, the year it took place, and the location of the circuit for the races with the most laps. It joins the `races`, `results`, and `circuits` tables to gather the necessary information and uses a subquery to find the maximum number of laps from the `results` table."
