"```sql\nSELECT DisplayName, SUM(ViewCount) AS TotalViewCount\nFROM posts\nJOIN users ON posts.OwnerUserId = users.Id\nWHERE DisplayName IN ('Harvey Motulsky', 'Noah Snyder')\nGROUP BY DisplayName\nORDER BY TotalViewCount DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the total view count for posts authored by either Harvey Motulsky or Noah Snyder. It joins the `posts` and `users` tables using the `OwnerUserId` and `Id` columns, respectively, and filters the results to include only the specified display names. The query then groups the results by `DisplayName`, sums the `ViewCount` for each author, and orders the results in descending order of total view count, returning the author with the highest total view count."
