"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT constructors.constructorId)\nFROM constructors\nJOIN results ON constructors.constructorId = results.constructorId\nJOIN lapTimes ON results.raceId = lapTimes.raceId AND results.driverId = lapTimes.driverId\nWHERE constructors.nationality = 'French' AND lapTimes.lap > 50;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct French constructors that have participated in races where the lap number is greater than 50. It joins the `constructors`, `results`, and `lapTimes` tables to filter based on the constructor's nationality and the lap number condition."
