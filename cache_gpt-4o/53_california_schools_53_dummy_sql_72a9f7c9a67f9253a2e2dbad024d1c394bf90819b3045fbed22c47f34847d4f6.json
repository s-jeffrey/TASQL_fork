"```sql\nSELECT SUM(satscores.NumTstTakr)\nFROM satscores\nJOIN schools ON satscores.cds = schools.CDSCode\nWHERE schools.MailCity = 'Fresno';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the total number of SAT test takers for schools whose mailing city address is Fresno. It joins the `satscores` table with the `schools` table using the foreign key relationship between `satscores.cds` and `schools.CDSCode`. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include schools with a mailing city of 'Fresno'."
