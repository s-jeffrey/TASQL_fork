"```sql\nSELECT AVG(\n  CAST(SUBSTR(fastestLapTime, 1, INSTR(fastestLapTime, ':') - 1) AS INTEGER) * 60 +\n  CAST(SUBSTR(fastestLapTime, INSTR(fastestLapTime, ':') + 1) AS REAL)\n) AS average_fastest_lap_time_seconds\nFROM results\nJOIN drivers ON results.driverId = drivers.driverId\nWHERE drivers.forename = 'Lewis' AND drivers.surname = 'Hamilton';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the average fastest lap time in seconds for Lewis Hamilton across all Formula 1 races. It converts the `fastestLapTime` from the format 'MM:SS.mmm' to seconds by splitting the minutes and seconds, converting them to integers and real numbers, and then calculating the total seconds."
