"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE height < 180 AND overall_rating > 70) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS percentage\nFROM \n  Player\nJOIN \n  Player_Attributes ON Player.player_api_id = Player_Attributes.player_api_id;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of players who are under 180 cm in height and have an overall rating of more than 70. It uses a `JOIN` to combine the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables based on the `player_api_id`, and then applies a filter to count only those players who meet the specified conditions. The result is expressed as a percentage of the total number of players."
