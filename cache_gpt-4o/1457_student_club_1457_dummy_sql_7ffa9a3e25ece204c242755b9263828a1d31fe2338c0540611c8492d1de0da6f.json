"```sql\nSELECT CONCAT(m.first_name, ' ', m.last_name) AS full_name, m.phone\nFROM expense e\nJOIN member m ON e.link_to_member = m.member_id\nWHERE e.cost > (SELECT AVG(cost) FROM expense);\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the full name and contact number of members who have spent more than the average cost on expenses. It joins the `expense` table with the `member` table using the foreign key relationship and filters the results to include only those expenses where the cost is greater than the average cost of all expenses."
