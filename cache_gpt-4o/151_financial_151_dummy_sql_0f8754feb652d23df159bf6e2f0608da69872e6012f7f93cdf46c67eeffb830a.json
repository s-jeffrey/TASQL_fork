"```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT district.A2\nFROM account\nJOIN trans ON account.account_id = trans.account_id\nJOIN client ON account.account_id = disp.account_id\nJOIN district ON client.district_id = district.district_id\nWHERE trans.type = 'VYDAJ';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the distinct names of districts (`district.A2`) where accounts have made withdrawal transactions (`trans.type = 'VYDAJ'`). It joins the `account`, `trans`, `client`, and `district` tables using the appropriate foreign key relationships to ensure that the district names are correctly associated with the accounts that have made these transactions."
