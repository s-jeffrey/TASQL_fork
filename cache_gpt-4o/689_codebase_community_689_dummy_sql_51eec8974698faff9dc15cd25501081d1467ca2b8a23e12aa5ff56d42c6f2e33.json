"```sql\nSELECT u.DisplayName, u.Location\nFROM posts p\nJOIN users u ON p.LastEditorUserId = u.Id\nWHERE p.Id = 183\nORDER BY p.LastEditDate DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the display name and location of the user who was the last to edit the post with ID 183. It joins the `posts` table with the `users` table using the `LastEditorUserId` foreign key, orders the results by `LastEditDate` in descending order to ensure the most recent edit is considered, and limits the result to the top entry."
