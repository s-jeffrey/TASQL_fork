"```sql\nSELECT e.expense_description\nFROM budget b\nJOIN expense e ON b.budget_id = e.link_to_budget\nWHERE b.remaining = (\n  SELECT MIN(remaining)\n  FROM budget\n);\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the `expense_description` from the `expense` table for the budget entry with the lowest `remaining` amount. It uses a subquery to find the minimum `remaining` value in the `budget` table and then joins the `budget` and `expense` tables using the foreign key relationship to get the corresponding expenses."
