"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM client\nJOIN district ON client.district_id = district.district_id\nWHERE client.gender = 'M'\n  AND district.A3 = 'north Bohemia'\n  AND district.A11 > 8000;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of male customers (`gender = 'M'`) who are living in the \"north Bohemia\" region (`A3 = 'north Bohemia'`) and have an average salary greater than 8000 (`A11 > 8000`). The `JOIN` operation is used to connect the `client` and `district` tables based on the `district_id` foreign key relationship."
