"To answer the question \"What is the average of superheroes with no skin colour?\" based on the provided database schema, primary keys, foreign keys, and evidence, we need to calculate the average number of superheroes who have no skin color. The evidence suggests that \"no skin colour\" refers to `skin_colour_id` where `colour.id = 1`. However, the evidence provided for calculating the average seems incorrect because it uses a division that doesn't make sense in this context. Instead, we should focus on counting the superheroes with no skin color.\n\nHere's the SQL query to find the count of superheroes with no skin color:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS num_superheroes_no_skin_colour\nFROM superhero\nWHERE skin_colour_id IS NULL OR skin_colour_id = 0;\n```\n\nThis query counts the number of superheroes where the `skin_colour_id` is either `NULL` or `0`, which typically indicates missing or unspecified data. If `colour.id = 1` is meant to represent \"no skin color,\" you would need to adjust the query to reflect that specific condition. However, based on the typical database design, `NULL` or `0` is often used to represent missing data."
