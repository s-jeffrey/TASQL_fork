"```sql\nSELECT account.account_id, district.A2 AS district_name, district.A3 AS district_region\nFROM account\nJOIN district ON account.district_id = district.district_id\nWHERE account.date LIKE '93%' AND account.frequency = 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the account ID, district name, and district region for accounts created in 1993 where the statement is issued after the transaction. The `JOIN` operation is used to connect the `account` table with the `district` table using the `district_id` foreign key relationship. The `WHERE` clause filters the accounts based on the creation date and frequency criteria."
