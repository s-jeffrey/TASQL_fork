"```sql\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(CASE WHEN frpm.\"Charter Funding Type\" = 'Locally funded' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS \"Ratio in Percentage\"\nFROM \n    frpm\nJOIN \n    schools ON frpm.\"CDSCode\" = schools.\"CDSCode\"\nWHERE \n    schools.\"County\" = 'Santa Clara';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the ratio in percentage of schools in Santa Clara County that are locally funded compared to all other types of charter school funding. It uses a `JOIN` between the `frpm` and `schools` tables based on the `CDSCode` to filter schools located in Santa Clara County. The `COUNT` function is used to count the number of locally funded schools and the total number of schools, and the ratio is calculated accordingly."
