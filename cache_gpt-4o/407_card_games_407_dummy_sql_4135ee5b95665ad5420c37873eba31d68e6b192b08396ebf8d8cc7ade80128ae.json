"```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT fd.type\nFROM foreign_data fd\nJOIN set_translations st ON fd.uuid = st.setCode\nWHERE fd.language = 'German' AND fd.type IS NOT NULL;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects distinct card types from the `foreign_data` table where the language is German. It ensures that the `type` column is not null, which includes both subtypes and supertypes. The query joins the `foreign_data` table with the `set_translations` table using the `uuid` and `setCode` columns to ensure the correct language context."
