"```sql\nSELECT CONCAT(m.first_name, ' ', m.last_name) AS full_name\nFROM member m\nJOIN budget b ON m.member_id = b.link_to_event\nJOIN event e ON b.link_to_event = e.event_id\nWHERE e.event_name = 'Yearly Kickoff' AND m.position = 'Treasurer';\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the full name of the student who is managing the budget for the event named \"Yearly Kickoff.\" It assumes that the student managing the budget holds the position of \"Treasurer\" in the club. The query joins the `member`, `budget`, and `event` tables using the appropriate foreign key relationships and filters the results based on the event name and the member's position."
