"```sql\nSELECT c.originalReleaseDate, l.format\nFROM cards c\nJOIN legalities l ON c.uuid = l.uuid\nWHERE c.rarity = 'mythic' AND l.status = 'legal'\nORDER BY c.originalReleaseDate ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the original release date and legal play formats of the oldest mythic card. It joins the `cards` and `legalities` tables using the `uuid` foreign key relationship, filters for mythic rarity and legal status, orders the results by the release date in ascending order, and limits the output to the first result to find the oldest card."
