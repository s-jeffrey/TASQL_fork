"To answer the question \"What proportion of patients who had signs of thrombocytopenia had SLE diagnosed?\" using the given database schema, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Identify patients with thrombocytopenia symptoms.\n2. Identify patients diagnosed with SLE.\n3. Calculate the proportion of those with thrombocytopenia who also have an SLE diagnosis.\n\nBased on the schema, the `Symptoms` column in the `Examination` table can be used to identify thrombocytopenia, and the `Diagnosis` column in the `Examination` table can be used to identify SLE.\n\nHere's the SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(DISTINCT e1.ID) * 100.0 / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT e2.ID), 0)) AS proportion\nFROM \n    Examination e1\nJOIN \n    Examination e2 ON e1.ID = e2.ID\nWHERE \n    e1.Symptoms LIKE '%thrombocytopenia%' \n    AND e2.Diagnosis LIKE '%SLE%'\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We use a self-join on the `Examination` table to find patients who have both thrombocytopenia symptoms and an SLE diagnosis.\n- `e1` is used to filter patients with thrombocytopenia symptoms.\n- `e2` is used to filter patients diagnosed with SLE.\n- `COUNT(DISTINCT e1.ID)` gives the number of unique patients with thrombocytopenia symptoms who also have an SLE diagnosis.\n- `COUNT(DISTINCT e2.ID)` gives the total number of unique patients with thrombocytopenia symptoms.\n- The `NULLIF` function is used to avoid division by zero.\n- The result is multiplied by 100 to express the proportion as a percentage."
