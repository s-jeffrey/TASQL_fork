"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM frpm\nJOIN schools ON frpm.CDSCode = schools.CDSCode\nWHERE schools.County = 'Los Angeles'\n  AND schools.Charter = 0\n  AND (frpm.[Free Meal Count (K-12)] * 100.0 / frpm.[Enrollment (K-12)]) < 0.18;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of non-chartered schools in Los Angeles County where the percentage of students eligible for free meals in grades 1 through 12 is less than 0.18%. The query joins the `frpm` and `schools` tables using the `CDSCode` as the foreign key and applies the necessary conditions based on the evidence provided."
