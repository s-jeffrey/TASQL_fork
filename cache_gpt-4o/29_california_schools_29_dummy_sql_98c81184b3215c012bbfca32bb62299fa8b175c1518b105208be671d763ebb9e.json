"```sql\nSELECT s.OpenDate\nFROM schools s\nJOIN frpm f ON s.CDSCode = f.CDSCode\nORDER BY f.`Enrollment (K-12)` DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `schools` and `frpm` tables using the `CDSCode` as the foreign key. It then orders the results by the `Enrollment (K-12)` column in descending order to find the school with the largest enrollment from first through twelfth grade. Finally, it selects the `OpenDate` of that school and limits the result to one record."
