"```sql\nSELECT cards.name\nFROM cards\nJOIN foreign_data ON cards.uuid = foreign_data.uuid\nWHERE cards.availability = 'paper'\n  AND foreign_data.language = 'Japanese';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the names of cards that are only available in paper format and have a Japanese language entry in the `foreign_data` table. The query uses a join between the `cards` and `foreign_data` tables based on the `uuid` foreign key relationship."
