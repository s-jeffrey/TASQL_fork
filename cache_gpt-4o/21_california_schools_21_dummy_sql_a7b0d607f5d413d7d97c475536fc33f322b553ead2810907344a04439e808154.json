"To answer the question about the number of schools in Los Angeles that have more than 500 free meals but less than 700 free or reduced-price meals for K-12, we need to construct an SQL query that joins the relevant tables and applies the necessary filters. Here's how you can write the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM frpm\nJOIN schools ON frpm.CDSCode = schools.CDSCode\nWHERE schools.City = 'Los Angeles'\n  AND frpm.`Free Meal Count (K-12)` > 500\n  AND frpm.`FRPM Count (K-12)` < 700;\n```\n\nThis query does the following:\n- Joins the `frpm` table with the `schools` table using the `CDSCode` as the foreign key.\n- Filters the results to only include schools located in Los Angeles.\n- Applies the conditions to count schools with more than 500 free meals and less than 700 free or reduced-price meals for K-12 students."
