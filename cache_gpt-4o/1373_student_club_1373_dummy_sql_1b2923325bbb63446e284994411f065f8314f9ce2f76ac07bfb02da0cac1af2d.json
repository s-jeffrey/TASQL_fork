"To answer the question \"How many of the members' hometowns are from Maryland state?\" using the provided database schema, we need to join the `member` table with the `zip_code` table to filter members based on the state of their hometown ZIP code. Here's the SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM member\nJOIN zip_code ON member.zip = zip_code.zip_code\nWHERE zip_code.state = 'Maryland';\n```\n\nThis query counts the number of members whose hometown ZIP code corresponds to the state of Maryland."
