"```sql\nSELECT AdmFName1, District, COUNT(*) as Frequency\nFROM schools\nWHERE AdmFName1 IS NOT NULL\nGROUP BY AdmFName1, District\nORDER BY Frequency DESC\nLIMIT 2;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the two most common first names among school administrators and indicates the district to which they administer. It groups the results by the administrator's first name and district, counts the occurrences, and orders them by frequency in descending order, limiting the output to the top two results."
