"```sql\nSELECT AVG(loan.amount) AS average_loan_amount\nFROM loan\nJOIN disp ON loan.account_id = disp.account_id\nJOIN client ON disp.client_id = client.client_id\nWHERE client.gender = 'M';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the average loan amount for male borrowers by joining the `loan`, `disp`, and `client` tables. It uses the foreign key relationships to connect the tables and filters the results to include only male clients (`gender = 'M'`)."
