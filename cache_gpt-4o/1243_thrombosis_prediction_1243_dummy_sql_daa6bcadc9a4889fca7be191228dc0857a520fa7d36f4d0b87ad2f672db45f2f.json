"```sql\nSELECT \n    (SUM(CASE WHEN l.PT >= 14 AND p.SEX = 'F' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0) / NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN l.PT >= 14 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 0) AS percentage_of_females_with_abnormal_PT\nFROM \n    Patient p\nJOIN \n    Laboratory l ON p.ID = l.ID\nWHERE \n    YEAR(CURRENT_DATE) - YEAR(p.Birthday) > 55;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of female patients older than 55 years who have an abnormal prothrombin time (PT). It joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables on the `ID` column, filters for patients older than 55, and checks for abnormal PT values (PT >= 14). The percentage is calculated by dividing the count of females with abnormal PT by the total count of patients with abnormal PT, multiplied by 100. The `NULLIF` function is used to prevent division by zero."
