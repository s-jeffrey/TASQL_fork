"```sql\nSELECT \n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM member \n     JOIN major ON member.link_to_major = major.major_id \n     WHERE major.major_name = 'Finance')::float / \n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM member \n     JOIN major ON member.link_to_major = major.major_id \n     WHERE major.major_name = 'Physics')::float AS ratio;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the ratio between students majoring in Finance and those majoring in Physics. It uses subqueries to count the number of students in each major and then divides the count of Finance majors by the count of Physics majors. The `::float` is used to ensure that the division results in a floating-point number, which is important for obtaining a precise ratio."
