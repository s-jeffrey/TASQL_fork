"```sql\nSELECT e.event_name\nFROM event e\nJOIN budget b ON e.event_id = b.link_to_event\nWHERE e.status = 'Closed'\nORDER BY (b.spent / b.amount) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the event name of the closed event with the highest spend-to-budget ratio. It joins the `event` and `budget` tables using the foreign key relationship and filters for events with a status of 'Closed'. It then orders the results by the spend-to-budget ratio in descending order and limits the output to the top result."
