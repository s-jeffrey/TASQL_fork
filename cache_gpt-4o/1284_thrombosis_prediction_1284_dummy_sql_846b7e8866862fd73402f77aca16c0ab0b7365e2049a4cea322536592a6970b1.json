"```sql\nSELECT P.Description\nFROM Patient P\nJOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID\nWHERE L.LDH < 500\nORDER BY L.LDH DESC, P.Description ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables using the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship. It filters the `Laboratory` records to include only those with `LDH` values in the normal range (less than 500). It then orders the results by `LDH` in descending order to find the highest value within the normal range and by `Description` in ascending order to get the earliest recorded date. Finally, it selects the `Description` column from the `Patient` table, which represents the first date when the patient's data was recorded, and limits the result to the top entry."
