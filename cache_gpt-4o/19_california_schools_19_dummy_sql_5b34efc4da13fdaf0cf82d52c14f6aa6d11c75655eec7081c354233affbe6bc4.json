"```sql\nSELECT s.Phone\nFROM satscores ss\nJOIN schools s ON ss.cds = s.CDSCode\nORDER BY ss.AvgScrMath DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the phone number of the school with the highest average score in Math from the `satscores` table. It joins the `satscores` table with the `schools` table using the foreign key relationship between `satscores.cds` and `schools.CDSCode`. The results are ordered by the `AvgScrMath` column in descending order to get the highest score, and the `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the top result is returned."
