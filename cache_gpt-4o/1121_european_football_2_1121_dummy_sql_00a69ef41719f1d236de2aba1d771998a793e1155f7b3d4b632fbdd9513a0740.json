"```sql\nSELECT SUM(M.home_team_goal) AS total_home_team_goals\nFROM Match M\nJOIN Player P ON M.home_team_api_id = P.player_api_id\nWHERE (strftime('%Y', 'now') - strftime('%Y', P.birthday)) < 31;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the total number of goals scored by home teams in matches where the players are 30 years old or younger. It joins the `Match` table with the `Player` table using the `home_team_api_id` and `player_api_id` to filter players based on their age. The age is calculated by subtracting the birth year from the current year, ensuring it is less than 31."
