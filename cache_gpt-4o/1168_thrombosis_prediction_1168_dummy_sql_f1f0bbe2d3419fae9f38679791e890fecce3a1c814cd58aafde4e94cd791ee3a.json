"```sql\nSELECT \n    Laboratory.Date AS LaboratoryDate, \n    (YEAR(Patient.First Date) - YEAR(Patient.Birthday)) AS AgeAtFirstVisit\nFROM \n    Patient\nJOIN \n    Examination ON Patient.ID = Examination.ID\nJOIN \n    Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE \n    Examination.Diagnosis = 'SjS'\nORDER BY \n    Patient.Birthday ASC, Laboratory.Date DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `Patient`, `Examination`, and `Laboratory` tables to find the oldest patient diagnosed with SjS (Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome) and retrieves the date of their latest laboratory work along with their age when they first arrived at the hospital. The results are ordered by the patient's birthday in ascending order (to find the oldest) and the laboratory date in descending order (to get the latest lab work). The `LIMIT 1` ensures that only the relevant record is returned."
