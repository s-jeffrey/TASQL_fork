"```sql\nSELECT P.Birthday\nFROM Patient P\nJOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID\nWHERE L.GPT < 60\nORDER BY L.GPT DESC\nLIMIT 3;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the birthdays of the top three patients with the highest glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) levels that are still within the normal range (less than 60). It joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables on the `ID` column, filters for GPT values less than 60, orders the results by GPT in descending order, and limits the output to the top three results."
