"```sql\nSELECT trans.trans_id, trans.date, trans.type, trans.operation, trans.amount, trans.balance, trans.k_symbol, trans.bank, trans.account\nFROM trans\nJOIN account ON trans.account_id = account.account_id\nWHERE account.district_id = 5;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects all the transactions made by accounts from district 5. It joins the `trans` table with the `account` table using the `account_id` foreign key relationship and filters the results to include only those transactions where the `district_id` in the `account` table is 5."
