"```sql\nSELECT constructors.name, constructors.nationality, SUM(constructorResults.points) AS total_points\nFROM races\nJOIN constructorResults ON races.raceId = constructorResults.raceId\nJOIN constructors ON constructorResults.constructorId = constructors.constructorId\nWHERE races.name = 'Monaco Grand Prix' AND races.year BETWEEN 1980 AND 2010\nGROUP BY constructors.constructorId\nORDER BY total_points DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the name and nationality of the constructor that scored the most points in the Monaco Grand Prix between 1980 and 2010. It joins the `races`, `constructorResults`, and `constructors` tables to gather the necessary information, filters the races to only include the Monaco Grand Prix within the specified years, and then groups the results by constructor to sum their points. Finally, it orders the results by total points in descending order and limits the output to the top result."
