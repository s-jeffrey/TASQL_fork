"```sql\nSELECT d.A2 AS district_name, t.amount\nFROM trans t\nJOIN account a ON t.account_id = a.account_id\nJOIN client c ON a.account_id = c.client_id\nJOIN district d ON c.district_id = d.district_id\nWHERE t.type = 'VYDAJ' AND t.date LIKE '1996-01%'\nORDER BY t.amount DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the top ten non-credit card withdrawals by district names for January 1996. It joins the `trans`, `account`, `client`, and `district` tables to access the necessary information, filters for withdrawals (`type = 'VYDAJ'`) in January 1996 (`date LIKE '1996-01%'`), and orders the results by the withdrawal amount in descending order, limiting the output to the top ten results."
