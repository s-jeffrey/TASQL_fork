"```sql\nSELECT loan.account_id, district.A2 AS district, district.A3 AS region\nFROM loan\nJOIN account ON loan.account_id = account.account_id\nJOIN district ON account.district_id = district.district_id\nWHERE loan.amount > 300000;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the account ID, district name, and region name for loans with an amount greater than USD 300,000. It joins the `loan`, `account`, and `district` tables using the foreign key relationships defined in the schema. The `A2` column in the `district` table provides the district names, and the `A3` column provides the region names."
