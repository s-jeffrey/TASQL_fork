"```sql\nSELECT \n  (SUM(CASE WHEN Diagnosis = 'BEHCET' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS percentage\nFROM \n  Patient\nWHERE \n  SEX = 'M' \n  AND YEAR(`First Date`) = 1981;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of male patients who first presented to the hospital in 1981 and were diagnosed with BEHCET. It uses a conditional aggregation to count the number of patients diagnosed with BEHCET and divides it by the total number of male patients who first presented in 1981, then multiplies by 100 to get the percentage."
