"```sql\nSELECT c.name\nFROM cards c\nJOIN sets s ON c.setCode = s.code\nWHERE s.name = 'Coldsnap'\nORDER BY c.convertedManaCost DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\nThis SQL query selects the name of the card(s) from the set \"Coldsnap\" with the highest converted mana cost. It joins the `cards` and `sets` tables using the `setCode` and `code` columns, filters for the set named \"Coldsnap\", and orders the results by `convertedManaCost` in descending order, limiting the output to the top result."
