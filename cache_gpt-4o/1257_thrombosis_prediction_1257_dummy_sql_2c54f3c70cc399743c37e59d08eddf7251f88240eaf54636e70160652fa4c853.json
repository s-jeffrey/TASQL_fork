"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Laboratory.CRE >= 1.5\nAND (YEAR(CURDATE()) - YEAR(Patient.Birthday)) < 70;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of patients whose creatinine level is abnormal (CRE >= 1.5) and who are not yet 70 years old. It joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables using the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship, and applies the conditions specified in the evidence."
