"```sql\nSELECT p.Description, COUNT(t.ProductID) AS SalesCount\nFROM transactions_1k t\nJOIN products p ON t.ProductID = p.ProductID\nGROUP BY p.Description\nORDER BY SalesCount DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `transactions_1k` table with the `products` table using the `ProductID` to count the number of transactions for each product. It then orders the results by the count in descending order to find the top five best-selling products, and limits the output to five results. The `Description` column from the `products` table is used to provide the full name of the products."
