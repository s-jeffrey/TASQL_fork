"```sql\nSELECT MIN(posts.CreaionDate)\nFROM users\nJOIN posts ON users.Id = posts.OwnerUserId\nWHERE users.Age = (SELECT MIN(Age) FROM users);\n```\n\nThis SQL query finds the date when the youngest user made their first post. It first identifies the youngest user by finding the minimum age in the `users` table. Then, it joins the `users` table with the `posts` table using the `OwnerUserId` foreign key to find the creation date of the first post made by this user."
