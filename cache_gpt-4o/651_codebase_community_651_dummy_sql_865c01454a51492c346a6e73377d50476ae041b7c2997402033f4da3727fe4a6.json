"To generate the SQL query to answer the question, we need to identify the relevant tables and columns based on the database schema, primary keys, and foreign keys provided. The question asks for the \"related post title\" of a specific post, which implies that we need to find the related post through the `postLinks` table and then retrieve the title from the `posts` table.\n\nHere's how we can construct the SQL query:\n\n1. **Identify the tables involved**:\n   - `postLinks`: To find the related post.\n   - `posts`: To get the title of the related post.\n\n2. **Determine the relationships**:\n   - `postLinks.PostId` and `postLinks.RelatedPostId` are related to `posts.Id`.\n   - We need to find the `Id` of the post with the title \"How to tell if something happened in a data set which monitors a value over time\" first.\n\n3. **Construct the SQL query**:\n   - First, find the `Id` of the post with the given title.\n   - Then, use this `Id` to find the related post through the `postLinks` table.\n   - Finally, retrieve the title of the related post from the `posts` table.\n\nHere is the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT related_posts.Title\nFROM posts AS original_post\nJOIN postLinks ON original_post.Id = postLinks.PostId\nJOIN posts AS related_posts ON postLinks.RelatedPostId = related_posts.Id\nWHERE original_post.Title = 'How to tell if something happened in a data set which monitors a value over time';\n```\n\nThis query first identifies the original post by its title, then finds related posts through the `postLinks` table, and finally retrieves the title of the related post."
