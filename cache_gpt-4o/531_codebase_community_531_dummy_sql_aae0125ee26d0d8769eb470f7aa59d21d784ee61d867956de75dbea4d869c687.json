"```sql\nSELECT DisplayName, Reputation\nFROM users\nWHERE DisplayName IN ('Harlan', 'Jarrod Dixon')\nORDER BY Reputation DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the `DisplayName` and `Reputation` of users whose display names are either \"Harlan\" or \"Jarrod Dixon\". It orders the results by `Reputation` in descending order and limits the output to the top result, effectively identifying the user with the higher reputation."
