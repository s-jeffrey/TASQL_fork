"```sql\nSELECT \n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM superhero WHERE gender_id = (SELECT id FROM gender WHERE gender = 'Male'))::float /\n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM superhero WHERE gender_id = (SELECT id FROM gender WHERE gender = 'Female'))::float AS male_to_female_ratio;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the ratio between male and female superheroes by counting the number of superheroes with a gender of 'Male' and dividing it by the number of superheroes with a gender of 'Female'. The `::float` is used to ensure that the division results in a floating-point number, which is important for getting an accurate ratio."
