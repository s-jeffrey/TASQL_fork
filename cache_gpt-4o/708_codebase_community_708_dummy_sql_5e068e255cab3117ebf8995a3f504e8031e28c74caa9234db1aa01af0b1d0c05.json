"```sql\nSELECT u.CreationDate, u.Age\nFROM comments c\nJOIN users u ON c.UserId = u.Id\nWHERE c.Text LIKE '%http://%';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the creation date and age of users who have commented with a website link. It joins the `comments` table with the `users` table using the foreign key relationship `comments.UserId = users.Id` and filters the comments to include only those that contain 'http://', indicating the presence of a website link."
