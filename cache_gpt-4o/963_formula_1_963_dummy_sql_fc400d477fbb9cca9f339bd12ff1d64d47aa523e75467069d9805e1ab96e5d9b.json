"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT drivers.driverId)\nFROM lapTimes\nJOIN drivers ON lapTimes.driverId = drivers.driverId\nWHERE drivers.nationality = 'French'\nAND (CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(lapTimes.time, ':', 1) AS UNSIGNED) * 60 + CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(lapTimes.time, ':', -1) AS DECIMAL(5,3))) < 120;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct French drivers who have recorded a lap time of less than 2 minutes (120 seconds). It joins the `lapTimes` table with the `drivers` table using the `driverId` foreign key and filters the results based on the driver's nationality and the lap time condition."
