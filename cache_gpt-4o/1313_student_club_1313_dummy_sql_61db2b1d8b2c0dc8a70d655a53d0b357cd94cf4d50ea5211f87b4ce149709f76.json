"To answer the question \"How many students in the Student_Club are from the College of Engineering?\" using the provided database schema, we need to join the `member` table with the `major` table to filter members whose major is offered by the College of Engineering. Here's the SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM member\nJOIN major ON member.link_to_major = major.major_id\nWHERE major.college = 'College of Engineering';\n```\n\nThis query counts the number of members whose major is associated with the College of Engineering by joining the `member` table with the `major` table using the foreign key relationship `member.link_to_major = major.major_id`. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include those from the College of Engineering."
