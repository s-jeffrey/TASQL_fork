"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Patient WHERE SEX = 'F')) AS percentage\nFROM \n  Laboratory\nJOIN \n  Patient ON Laboratory.ID = Patient.ID\nWHERE \n  Laboratory.UA > 6.5 AND Patient.SEX = 'F';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of female patients whose uric acid (UA) levels are beyond the normal range for females (UA > 6.5). It joins the `Laboratory` and `Patient` tables on the `ID` column, filters for female patients with UA levels above 6.5, and then calculates the percentage based on the total number of female patients."
