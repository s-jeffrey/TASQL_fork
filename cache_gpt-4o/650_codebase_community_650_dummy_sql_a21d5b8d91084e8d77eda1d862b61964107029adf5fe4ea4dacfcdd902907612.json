"```sql\nSELECT users.LastAccessDate, users.Location\nFROM users\nJOIN badges ON users.Id = badges.UserId\nWHERE badges.Name = 'Outliers';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the `LastAccessDate` and `Location` of users who have received the badge named \"Outliers\". It joins the `users` table with the `badges` table using the `UserId` foreign key relationship and filters the results to only include those where the badge name is \"Outliers\"."
