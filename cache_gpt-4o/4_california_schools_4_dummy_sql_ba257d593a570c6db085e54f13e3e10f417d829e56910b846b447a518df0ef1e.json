"```sql\nSELECT s.Phone\nFROM frpm f\nJOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode\nWHERE f.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1\n  AND f.`Charter Funding Type` = 'Directly funded'\n  AND s.OpenDate > '2000-01-01';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the phone numbers of schools that are directly charter-funded and opened after January 1, 2000. It uses the `frpm` table to filter for charter schools (`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1) and directly funded charter schools (`Charter Funding Type` = 'Directly funded'). It joins with the `schools` table to access the `OpenDate` and `Phone` columns, ensuring that only schools opened after the specified date are included."
