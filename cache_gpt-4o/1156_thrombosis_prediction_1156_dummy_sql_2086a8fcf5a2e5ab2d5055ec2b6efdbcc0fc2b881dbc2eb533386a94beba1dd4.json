"```sql\nSELECT Patient.ID, \n       YEAR(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) - YEAR(Patient.Birthday) AS age\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Examination ON Patient.ID = Examination.ID\nWHERE Examination.RVVT = '+';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the ID and calculates the age of patients who have a positive degree of coagulation, as indicated by the RVVT column in the Examination table. The age is calculated by subtracting the birth year from the current year. The query joins the Patient and Examination tables using the foreign key relationship between Patient.ID and Examination.ID."
