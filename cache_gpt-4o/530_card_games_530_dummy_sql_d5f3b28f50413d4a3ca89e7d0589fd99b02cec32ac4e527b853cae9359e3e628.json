"```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT c.frameVersion, c.name\nFROM cards c\nJOIN legalities l ON c.uuid = l.uuid\nWHERE c.artist = 'Allen Williams'\n   OR l.status = 'banned';\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the distinct frame styles (`frameVersion`) and card names (`name`) from the `cards` table where the artist is Allen Williams or the card is banned. It joins the `cards` table with the `legalities` table using the `uuid` foreign key relationship to check for banned status."
