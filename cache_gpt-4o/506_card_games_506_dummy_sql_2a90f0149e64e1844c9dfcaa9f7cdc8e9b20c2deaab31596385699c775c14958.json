"```sql\nSELECT \n  (SUM(CASE WHEN s.isNonFoilOnly = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS percentage_non_foil\nFROM \n  set_translations st\nJOIN \n  sets s ON st.setCode = s.code\nWHERE \n  st.language = 'Japanese';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of card sets that have a Japanese translation and are only available in non-foil. It uses a `JOIN` between the `set_translations` and `sets` tables based on the `setCode`, and filters for entries where the language is Japanese. The calculation for the percentage is done by dividing the count of sets that are non-foil only by the total count of Japanese-translated sets, then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage."
