"```sql\nSELECT constructors.url\nFROM constructors\nJOIN constructorStandings ON constructors.constructorId = constructorStandings.constructorId\nGROUP BY constructors.constructorId\nORDER BY SUM(constructorStandings.wins) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `constructors` and `constructorStandings` tables to find the constructor with the most total wins. It selects the `url` of the constructor, groups the results by `constructorId`, and orders them by the sum of wins in descending order, returning the top result."
