"```sql\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(s.id) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM superhero WHERE alignment_id = 2)) AS female_percentage\nFROM \n    superhero s\nJOIN \n    gender g ON s.gender_id = g.id\nWHERE \n    s.alignment_id = 2 AND g.id = 2;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of female superheroes among those with a \"bad\" alignment. It uses the `alignment_id = 2` to filter for bad superheroes and `gender.id = 2` to filter for female superheroes. The percentage is calculated by dividing the count of female superheroes with a bad alignment by the total count of superheroes with a bad alignment, then multiplying by 100."
