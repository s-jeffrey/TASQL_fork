"```sql\nSELECT c.name, c.url\nFROM constructors c\nJOIN constructorStandings cs ON c.constructorId = cs.constructorId\nWHERE c.nationality = 'Italian'\nORDER BY cs.points DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the name and introduction website (url) of the Italian constructor with the highest points to date. It joins the `constructors` and `constructorStandings` tables on the `constructorId`, filters for constructors with Italian nationality, and orders the results by points in descending order, returning the top result."
