"```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT Patient.ID\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Patient.Admission = '-' AND Laboratory.CPK < 250;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects distinct patient IDs from the `Patient` table who are outpatients (indicated by `Admission = '-'`) and have a creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) level within the normal range (less than 250) as recorded in the `Laboratory` table. The query uses a join between the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on the patient ID, which is a foreign key relationship."
