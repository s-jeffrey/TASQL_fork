"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a.account_id)\nFROM account a\nJOIN client c ON a.account_id = c.client_id\nJOIN district d ON a.district_id = d.district_id\nLEFT JOIN disp dp ON a.account_id = dp.account_id\nLEFT JOIN card cd ON dp.disp_id = cd.disp_id\nWHERE d.A3 = 'south Bohemia' AND cd.card_id IS NULL;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct account holders in the \"south Bohemia\" region who do not own credit cards. It joins the `account`, `client`, `district`, `disp`, and `card` tables to filter the accounts based on the region and checks for the absence of a credit card by ensuring `card_id` is `NULL`."
