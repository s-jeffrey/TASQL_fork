"```sql\nSELECT l.format\nFROM cards c\nJOIN legalities l ON c.uuid = l.uuid\nWHERE c.artist = (\n    SELECT artist\n    FROM cards\n    GROUP BY artist\n    ORDER BY COUNT(*) ASC\n    LIMIT 1\n);\n```\nThis SQL query finds the format of play for the cards illustrated by the artist who has illustrated the least number of cards. It uses a subquery to determine the artist with the minimum number of cards illustrated and then joins the `cards` and `legalities` tables to list the formats of play for those cards."
