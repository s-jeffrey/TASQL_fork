"```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT Patient.ID\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Patient.SEX = 'M' AND Laboratory.GPT >= 60;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects distinct patient IDs from the `Patient` table where the patient's sex is male (`SEX = 'M'`) and the patient's ALT glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) level in the `Laboratory` table exceeds the normal range (GPT >= 60). The `JOIN` operation is used to link the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on the patient ID, which is a common field in both tables."
