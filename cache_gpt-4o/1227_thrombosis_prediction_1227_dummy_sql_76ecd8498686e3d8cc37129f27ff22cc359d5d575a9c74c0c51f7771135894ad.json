"```sql\nSELECT AVG(YEAR(CURDATE()) - YEAR(P.Birthday)) AS average_age\nFROM Patient P\nJOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID\nWHERE P.SEX = 'M' AND L.T-CHO >= 250;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the average age of male patients with high cholesterol (defined as `T-CHO` >= 250) by joining the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables on the `ID` column. It filters for male patients (`SEX = 'M'`) and those with high cholesterol, then computes the average age based on the current year minus the birth year."
