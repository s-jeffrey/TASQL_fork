"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(a.link_to_event) AS number_of_events, m.major_name\nFROM member AS m\nJOIN attendance AS a ON m.member_id = a.link_to_member\nJOIN major AS mj ON m.link_to_major = mj.major_id\nWHERE m.first_name = 'Luisa' AND m.last_name = 'Guidi'\nGROUP BY m.major_name;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of events attended by the member named Luisa Guidi and retrieves her major. It uses the `attendance` table to count the events and the `major` table to get the major name. The query joins the `member`, `attendance`, and `major` tables using the appropriate foreign keys."
