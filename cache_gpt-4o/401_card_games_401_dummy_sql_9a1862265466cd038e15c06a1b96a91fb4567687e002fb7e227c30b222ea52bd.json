"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(CASE WHEN isOnlineOnly = 1 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(id)) AS percentage\nFROM \n  cards\nWHERE \n  frameEffects = 'legendary';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of cards with the 'legendary' frame effect that are only available in online game variations. It does this by dividing the count of such cards (`isOnlineOnly = 1`) by the total count of 'legendary' frame effect cards and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage."
