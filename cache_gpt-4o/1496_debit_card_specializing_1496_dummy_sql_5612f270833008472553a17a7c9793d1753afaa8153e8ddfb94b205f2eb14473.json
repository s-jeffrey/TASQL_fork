"```sql\nSELECT c.Segment\nFROM yearmonth ym\nJOIN customers c ON ym.CustomerID = c.CustomerID\nWHERE ym.Date = '201309'\nGROUP BY c.Segment\nORDER BY SUM(ym.Consumption) ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `yearmonth` table with the `customers` table using the `CustomerID` foreign key relationship. It filters the data for September 2013 (`ym.Date = '201309'`), groups the results by the `Segment` column from the `customers` table, and orders the groups by the total consumption in ascending order. The `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the segment with the least consumption is returned."
