"```sql\nSELECT p.ID, l.T-CHO\nFROM Patient p\nJOIN Laboratory l ON p.ID = l.ID\nWHERE p.Birthday = (SELECT MIN(Birthday) FROM Patient)\nORDER BY l.T-CHO DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the patient ID and the highest total cholesterol (T-CHO) value for the oldest patient. It joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables on the patient ID, filters for the oldest patient by finding the minimum birthday, and orders the results by T-CHO in descending order to get the highest value. The `LIMIT 1` ensures that only the patient with the highest T-CHO is returned."
