"```sql\nSELECT constructors.name\nFROM constructors\nJOIN constructorStandings ON constructors.constructorId = constructorStandings.constructorId\nORDER BY constructorStandings.points DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the name of the constructor with the highest points from the `constructorStandings` table. It joins the `constructors` table with the `constructorStandings` table using the `constructorId` as the foreign key. The results are ordered by the `points` column in descending order, and the `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the constructor with the highest points is returned."
