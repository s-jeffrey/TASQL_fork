"```sql\nSELECT s.School, s.FundingType\nFROM satscores ss\nJOIN schools s ON ss.cds = s.CDSCode\nWHERE s.County = 'Riverside'\nGROUP BY s.School, s.FundingType\nHAVING AVG(ss.AvgScrMath) > 400;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the names of schools and their funding types from the `schools` table, where the schools are located in Riverside County and the average of the average math scores for SAT is greater than 400. The query uses a join between the `satscores` and `schools` tables based on the foreign key relationship, and it groups the results by school and funding type to calculate the average math score."
