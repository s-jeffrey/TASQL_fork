"```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT foreign_data.language\nFROM foreign_data\nJOIN cards ON foreign_data.uuid = cards.uuid\nWHERE cards.name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen' AND foreign_data.flavorText IS NOT NULL;\n```\nThis SQL query selects distinct foreign languages from the `foreign_data` table where the card name is \"Ancestor's Chosen\" and there is a non-null flavor text. The query uses a join between the `foreign_data` and `cards` tables based on the `uuid` foreign key relationship."
