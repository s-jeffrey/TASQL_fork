"```sql\nSELECT AVG(e.cost) AS average_cost\nFROM expense e\nJOIN member m ON e.link_to_member = m.member_id\nWHERE m.first_name = 'Elijah' AND m.last_name = 'Allen'\nAND (MONTH(e.expense_date) = 9 OR MONTH(e.expense_date) = 10);\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the average cost of expenses incurred by Elijah Allen during the months of September and October. It joins the `expense` table with the `member` table to filter expenses by the member's full name and then checks the month of the `expense_date` to ensure it falls within September or October."
