"```sql\nSELECT d.forename, d.surname\nFROM results r\nJOIN drivers d ON r.driverId = d.driverId\nWHERE r.fastestLapSpeed = (\n    SELECT MAX(fastestLapSpeed) FROM results\n);\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the forename and surname of the driver who achieved the fastest lap speed in a Formula 1 race. It uses a subquery to find the maximum fastest lap speed from the `results` table and then joins the `drivers` table to get the corresponding driver's details."
