"```sql\nSELECT c.id, r.text, c.hasContentWarning\nFROM cards c\nJOIN rulings r ON c.uuid = r.uuid\nWHERE c.artist = 'Jim Pavelec';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the card ID, the text of the ruling, and the `hasContentWarning` status for all cards illustrated by Jim Pavelec. It joins the `cards` table with the `rulings` table using the `uuid` foreign key relationship to retrieve the relevant ruling text. The `hasContentWarning` column is used to determine if the cards have missing or degraded properties and values."
