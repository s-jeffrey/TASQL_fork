"```sql\nSELECT County, School, ClosedDate\nFROM schools\nWHERE StatusType = 'Closed'\nGROUP BY County, School, ClosedDate\nORDER BY COUNT(School) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the county with the most closed schools, listing each school's name and its closure date. It filters the schools with a 'Closed' status, groups the results by county, school, and closure date, and orders them by the count of schools in descending order, returning the top result."
