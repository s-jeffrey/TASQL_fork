"```sql\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(p.Id) FILTER (WHERE t.TagName = 'r')::float / COUNT(p.Id) FILTER (WHERE u.DisplayName = 'Community')) * 100 AS percentage\nFROM \n    posts p\nJOIN \n    users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id\nJOIN \n    tags t ON t.ExcerptPostId = p.Id\nWHERE \n    u.DisplayName = 'Community';\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Tables Involved**: The query involves the `posts`, `users`, and `tags` tables.\n- **Joins**: \n  - `posts` is joined with `users` to filter posts made by the user with the display name \"Community\".\n  - `tags` is joined with `posts` to filter posts tagged with \"r\".\n- **Filter Conditions**:\n  - The `WHERE` clause ensures that only posts by \"Community\" are considered.\n  - The `FILTER` clause in the `COUNT` function is used to count posts with the tag \"r\".\n- **Calculation**: The percentage is calculated by dividing the count of posts tagged with \"r\" by the total count of posts by \"Community\", and then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage."
