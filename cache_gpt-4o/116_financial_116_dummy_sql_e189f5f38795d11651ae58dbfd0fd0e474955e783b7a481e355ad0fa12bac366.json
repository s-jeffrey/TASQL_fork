"To answer the question using SQL, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the client whose loan was approved first on 1993/7/5.\n2. Find the account associated with this client.\n3. Retrieve the account balance on the specified dates: 1993/3/22 and 1998/12/27.\n4. Calculate the increase rate of the account balance using the provided formula.\n\nHere's the SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    ((balance_1998 - balance_1993) / balance_1993) * 100 AS increase_rate\nFROM (\n    SELECT \n        t1.account_id,\n        MAX(CASE WHEN t1.date = '1998-12-27' THEN t1.balance ELSE NULL END) AS balance_1998,\n        MAX(CASE WHEN t1.date = '1993-03-22' THEN t1.balance ELSE NULL END) AS balance_1993\n    FROM trans t1\n    JOIN loan l ON t1.account_id = l.account_id\n    JOIN disp d ON l.account_id = d.account_id\n    JOIN client c ON d.client_id = c.client_id\n    WHERE l.date = '1993-07-05'\n    GROUP BY t1.account_id\n) AS balances;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Subquery**: We use a subquery to select the account balances on the specified dates for the account associated with the loan approved on 1993/7/5.\n- **JOINs**: We join the `trans`, `loan`, `disp`, and `client` tables to link transactions to the client through the account and loan.\n- **CASE WHEN**: We use `CASE WHEN` to extract balances for the specific dates.\n- **GROUP BY**: We group by `account_id` to ensure we get balances for the correct account.\n- **Calculation**: The outer query calculates the increase rate using the formula provided in the evidence."
