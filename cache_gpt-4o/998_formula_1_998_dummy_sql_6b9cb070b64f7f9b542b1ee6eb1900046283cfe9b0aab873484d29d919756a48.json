"To answer the question about the number of victories (wins) acquired by the driver who ranked 91st in terms of points, we need to query the `driverStandings` table. The `positionText` column can be used to find the rank, and the `wins` column will give us the number of victories. Here's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT wins\nFROM driverStandings\nWHERE positionText = '91'\n```\n\nThis query selects the number of wins for the driver who is ranked 91st in the standings."
