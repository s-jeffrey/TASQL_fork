"```sql\nSELECT lt.time\nFROM lapTimes lt\nJOIN drivers d ON lt.driverId = d.driverId\nWHERE d.forename = 'Lewis' AND d.surname = 'Hamilton'\nORDER BY lt.milliseconds ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the fastest lap time set by Lewis Hamilton in a Formula 1 race. It joins the `lapTimes` table with the `drivers` table to filter the records for Lewis Hamilton and orders the results by the lap time in milliseconds in ascending order, returning the fastest lap time."
