"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(DISTINCT b.molecule_id) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id)) AS percent_triple_bond\nFROM \n  bond b\nJOIN \n  molecule m ON b.molecule_id = m.molecule_id\nWHERE \n  b.bond_type = '#';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of molecules that contain at least one triple bond. It does this by counting the distinct `molecule_id`s in the `bond` table where the `bond_type` is a triple bond ('#'), and then dividing by the total number of distinct `molecule_id`s in the `molecule` table. The result is multiplied by 100 to convert it to a percentage."
