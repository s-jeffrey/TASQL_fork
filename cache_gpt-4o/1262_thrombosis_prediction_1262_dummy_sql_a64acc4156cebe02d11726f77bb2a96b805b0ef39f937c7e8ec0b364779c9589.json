"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Examination.ID)\nFROM Examination\nJOIN Laboratory ON Examination.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Laboratory.C3 > 35 AND Examination.`ANA Pattern` = 'P';\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct patients who have a normal level of complement 3 (C3 > 35) and a 'P' pattern observed in the sheet of ANA examination. The query joins the `Examination` and `Laboratory` tables using the patient ID, which is a foreign key relationship."
