"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Patient.ID)\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Laboratory.IGA > 80\n  AND Laboratory.IGA < 500\n  AND YEAR(Patient.`First Date`) >= 1990;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct patients who have a normal Ig A level (between 80 and 500) and who came to the hospital on or after January 1, 1990. The query uses a join between the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship."
