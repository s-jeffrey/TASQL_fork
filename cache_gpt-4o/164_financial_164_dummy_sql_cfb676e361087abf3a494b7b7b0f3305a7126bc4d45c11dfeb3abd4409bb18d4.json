"To answer the question \"Who placed the order with the id 32423?\", we need to identify the client associated with the order. This involves joining the `order`, `account`, `disp`, and `client` tables using the foreign key relationships. Here's the SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT client.client_id\nFROM order\nJOIN account ON order.account_id = account.account_id\nJOIN disp ON account.account_id = disp.account_id\nJOIN client ON disp.client_id = client.client_id\nWHERE order.order_id = 32423;\n```\n\nThis query selects the `client_id` from the `client` table by joining the necessary tables based on the foreign key relationships, and it filters the results to only include the order with `order_id` 32423."
