"```sql\nSELECT Player.birthday\nFROM Player\nJOIN Player_Attributes ON Player.player_api_id = Player_Attributes.player_api_id\nORDER BY Player_Attributes.overall_rating DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables using the `player_api_id` foreign key relationship. It then orders the results by the `overall_rating` in descending order to find the player with the highest overall rating and selects the `birthday` of that player. The `LIMIT 1` ensures that only the top result is returned."
