"```sql\nSELECT g.Country\nFROM transactions_1k t\nJOIN gasstations g ON t.GasStationID = g.GasStationID\nWHERE t.ProductID = 2\nORDER BY t.Price DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `transactions_1k` table with the `gasstations` table to find the country of the gas station that sold the most expensive product with `ProductID` 2 for one unit. It orders the results by price in descending order and limits the output to the top result to find the most expensive sale."
