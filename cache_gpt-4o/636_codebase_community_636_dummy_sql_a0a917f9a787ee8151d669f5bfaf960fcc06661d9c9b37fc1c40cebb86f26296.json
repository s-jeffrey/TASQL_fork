"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM comments\nJOIN posts ON comments.PostId = posts.Id\nJOIN users ON posts.OwnerUserId = users.Id\nWHERE comments.Score < 60 AND users.DisplayName = 'Neil McGuigan';\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of negative comments (where the score is less than 60) on posts owned by the user with the display name 'Neil McGuigan'. It joins the `comments`, `posts`, and `users` tables to filter the comments based on the post ownership and user display name."
