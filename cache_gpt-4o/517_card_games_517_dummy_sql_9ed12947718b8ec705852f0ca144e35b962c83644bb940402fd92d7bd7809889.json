"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM cards\nJOIN legalities ON cards.uuid = legalities.uuid\nWHERE cards.rarity = 'rare'\n  AND cards.types LIKE '%Enchantment%'\n  AND cards.name = 'Abundance'\nGROUP BY cards.id\nHAVING COUNT(DISTINCT legalities.status) = 1 AND MIN(legalities.status) = 'legal';\n```\nThis SQL query counts the number of rare enchantment cards named \"Abundance\" that are legal in all play formats. It joins the `cards` and `legalities` tables on the `uuid` column, filters for the specified conditions, and ensures that the status is 'legal' for all formats by using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses."
