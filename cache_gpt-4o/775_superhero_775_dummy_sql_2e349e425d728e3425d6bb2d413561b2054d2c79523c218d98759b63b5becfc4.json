"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE c.colour = 'Blue')::float / COUNT(*)) * 100 AS percentage_of_blue_female_superheroes\nFROM \n  superhero s\nJOIN \n  colour c ON s.skin_colour_id = c.id\nJOIN \n  gender g ON s.gender_id = g.id\nWHERE \n  g.gender = 'Female';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of female superheroes with blue skin color among all female superheroes. It uses a `JOIN` to connect the `superhero`, `colour`, and `gender` tables based on their foreign key relationships, and applies a filter to count only those with the color 'Blue'. The result is then divided by the total count of female superheroes to get the percentage."
