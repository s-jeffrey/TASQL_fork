"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT molecule_id) FROM molecule WHERE label = '+')) AS percentage\nFROM \n  molecule m\nJOIN \n  atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id\nWHERE \n  m.label = '+' AND a.element = 'h';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of molecules that are carcinogenic (label = '+') and contain the element hydrogen (element = 'h'). It does this by joining the `molecule` and `atom` tables on `molecule_id`, filtering for carcinogenic molecules and hydrogen atoms, and then calculating the percentage based on the total number of carcinogenic molecules."
