"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Examination.ID)\nFROM Examination\nJOIN Laboratory ON Examination.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Laboratory.`T-BIL` >= 2.0\nAND Examination.`ANA Pattern` LIKE '%P%';\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct patients who have a total bilirubin level over the normal range (greater than or equal to 2.0) and have a peripheral pattern ('P') observed in the ANA examination. The query joins the `Examination` and `Laboratory` tables using the patient ID, which is a foreign key relationship."
