"```sql\nSELECT CONCAT(m.first_name, ' ', m.last_name) AS full_name, i.source\nFROM income i\nJOIN member m ON i.link_to_member = m.member_id\nWHERE i.amount = (SELECT MAX(amount) FROM income);\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the full name of the student and the income source for the student who generated the highest income. It uses a subquery to find the maximum income amount and then joins the `income` and `member` tables to get the corresponding member's full name and income source."
