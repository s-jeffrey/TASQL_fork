"```sql\nSELECT \n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools WHERE County = 'Colusa' AND MailState = 'CA')::float / \n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools WHERE County = 'Humboldt' AND MailState = 'CA') AS ratio;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the ratio of the number of schools located in Colusa County to the number of schools located in Humboldt County, considering only those schools with a mailing state address in California. The `::float` is used to ensure that the division results in a floating-point number, which is important for accurate ratio calculation."
