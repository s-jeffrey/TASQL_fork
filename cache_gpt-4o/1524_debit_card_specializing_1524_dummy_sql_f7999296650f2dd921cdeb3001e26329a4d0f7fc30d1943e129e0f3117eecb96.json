"```sql\nSELECT c.Country\nFROM yearmonth ym\nJOIN customers c ON ym.CustomerID = c.CustomerID\nWHERE ym.Consumption = 548.4 AND ym.Date = '201208';\n```\n\nThis SQL query is designed to find the nationality of the customer who spent 548.4 in August 2012. It uses the `yearmonth` table to find the consumption and date, and then joins with the `customers` table to retrieve the customer's country. The date '2012/8/24' is represented as '201208' in the `yearmonth` table."
