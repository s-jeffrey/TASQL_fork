"To answer the question, we need to find the number of views of users who obtained a badge on the specified date. We will use the `badges` and `users` tables, and join them based on the foreign key relationship `badges.UserId = users.Id`. Here's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT users.Views\nFROM badges\nJOIN users ON badges.UserId = users.Id\nWHERE badges.Date = '2010-07-19 19:39:08.0';\n```\n\nThis query selects the `Views` column from the `users` table for users who obtained a badge on the date '2010-07-19 19:39:08.0'."
