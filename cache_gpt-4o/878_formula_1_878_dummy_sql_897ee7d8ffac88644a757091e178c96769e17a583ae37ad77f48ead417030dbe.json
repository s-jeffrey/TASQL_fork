"```sql\nSELECT d.forename, d.surname\nFROM results r\nJOIN drivers d ON r.driverId = d.driverId\nWHERE r.raceId = 348\nORDER BY r.fastestLapTime ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `results` and `drivers` tables to find the driver with the best (fastest) lap time in the race with `raceId` 348. It orders the results by `fastestLapTime` in ascending order to get the minimum time and limits the result to the top entry, which corresponds to the driver with the best lap time."
