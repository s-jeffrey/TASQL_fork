"```sql\nSELECT AVG(1999 - YEAR(P.Birthday)) AS average_age\nFROM Patient P\nJOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID\nWHERE L.Date BETWEEN '1991-10-01' AND '1991-10-31';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the average age of patients as of the year 1999 who were examined in the laboratory during October 1991. It joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables on the `ID` column and filters the records to include only those with a `Date` in October 1991. The average age is computed by subtracting the birth year from 1999."
