"```sql\nSELECT e.event_name\nFROM event e\nJOIN attendance a ON e.event_id = a.link_to_event\nWHERE e.type != 'Fundraising'\nGROUP BY e.event_id\nHAVING COUNT(a.link_to_member) > 20;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the names of events from the `event` table that had an attendance of over 20 students and were not fundraisers. It joins the `event` table with the `attendance` table using the foreign key relationship, groups the results by event ID, and filters out events with a type of 'Fundraising'."
