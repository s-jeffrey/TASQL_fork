"```sql\nSELECT SUBSTRING(Date, 1, 4) AS Year, SUM(Consumption) AS TotalConsumption\nFROM yearmonth\nJOIN customers ON yearmonth.CustomerID = customers.CustomerID\nWHERE customers.Currency = 'CZK'\nGROUP BY Year\nORDER BY TotalConsumption DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the total consumption for each year where the currency is CZK, and then selects the year with the highest total consumption. It uses the `SUBSTRING` function to extract the year from the `Date` column in the `yearmonth` table."
