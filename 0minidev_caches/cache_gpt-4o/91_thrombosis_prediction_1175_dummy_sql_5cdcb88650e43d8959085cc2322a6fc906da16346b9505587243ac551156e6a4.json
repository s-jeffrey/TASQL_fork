"```sql\nSELECT \n  (YEAR(e.\"Examination Date\") - YEAR(p.Birthday)) AS Age,\n  e.Diagnosis\nFROM \n  Examination e\nJOIN \n  Laboratory l ON e.ID = l.ID\nJOIN \n  Patient p ON e.ID = p.ID\nWHERE \n  l.HGB = (\n    SELECT MAX(HGB) \n    FROM Laboratory\n  )\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the age of the patient at the time of the examination by subtracting the year of the patient's birthday from the year of the examination date. It also retrieves the doctor's diagnosis for the patient who had the highest hemoglobin count. The query joins the `Examination`, `Laboratory`, and `Patient` tables using the foreign key relationships and filters for the maximum hemoglobin count."
