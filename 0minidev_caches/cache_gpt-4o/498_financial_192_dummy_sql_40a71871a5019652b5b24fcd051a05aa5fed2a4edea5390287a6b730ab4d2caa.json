"```sql\nSELECT AVG(l.amount) AS average_loan_amount\nFROM loan l\nJOIN account a ON l.account_id = a.account_id\nJOIN trans t ON a.account_id = t.account_id\nWHERE l.status IN ('C', 'D') AND a.frequency = 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the average amount of loans that are still on a running contract (either 'OK so far' or 'client in debt') and have statement issuance after each transaction. The query joins the `loan`, `account`, and `trans` tables based on the foreign key relationships and filters the results based on the specified conditions."
