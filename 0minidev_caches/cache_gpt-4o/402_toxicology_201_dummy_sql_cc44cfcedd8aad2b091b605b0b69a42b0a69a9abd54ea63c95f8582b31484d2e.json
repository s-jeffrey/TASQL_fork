"```sql\nSELECT \n  (SUM(CASE WHEN a.element = 'c' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(a.atom_id)) AS carbon_percentage\nFROM \n  atom a\nJOIN \n  bond b ON a.molecule_id = b.molecule_id\nWHERE \n  b.bond_type = '='\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of carbon atoms in molecules that have at least one double bond. It joins the `atom` and `bond` tables on the `molecule_id` to ensure that the atoms and bonds belong to the same molecule. The `WHERE` clause filters for double bonds, and the `SUM` and `COUNT` functions are used to calculate the percentage of carbon atoms."
