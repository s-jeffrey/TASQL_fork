"```sql\nSELECT \n  ((y2012.Consumption - y2013.Consumption) / y2012.Consumption) AS ConsumptionDecreaseRate\nFROM \n  transactions_1k t\nJOIN \n  yearmonth y2012 ON t.CustomerID = y2012.CustomerID AND y2012.Date = '201208'\nJOIN \n  yearmonth y2013 ON t.CustomerID = y2013.CustomerID AND y2013.Date = '201308'\nWHERE \n  t.Amount = 634.8 AND t.Date = '2012-08-25';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the consumption decrease rate for the customer who made a transaction of 634.8 on 2012-08-25. It joins the `transactions_1k` table with the `yearmonth` table twice to get the consumption for August 2012 and August 2013, then calculates the decrease rate using the formula provided in the evidence."
