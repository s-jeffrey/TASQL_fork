"To generate the SQL query that calculates the difference in view count from posts posted by \"Mornington\" and \"Amos\", we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Join the `posts` table with the `users` table to access the `DisplayName` of the post owners.\n2. Filter the posts by the `DisplayName` of \"Mornington\" and \"Amos\".\n3. Calculate the sum of `ViewCount` for each user.\n4. Subtract the total view count of \"Amos\" from \"Mornington\".\n\nHere's the SQL query that accomplishes this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    (SUM(CASE WHEN u.DisplayName = 'Mornington' THEN p.ViewCount ELSE 0 END) -\n     SUM(CASE WHEN u.DisplayName = 'Amos' THEN p.ViewCount ELSE 0 END)) AS ViewCountDifference\nFROM \n    posts p\nJOIN \n    users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id\nWHERE \n    u.DisplayName IN ('Mornington', 'Amos');\n```\n\nThis query joins the `posts` and `users` tables on the `OwnerUserId` and `Id` columns, respectively. It then filters the results to include only posts by \"Mornington\" and \"Amos\". The `SUM` function is used with a `CASE` statement to calculate the total view count for each user, and the difference is computed directly in the `SELECT` clause."
