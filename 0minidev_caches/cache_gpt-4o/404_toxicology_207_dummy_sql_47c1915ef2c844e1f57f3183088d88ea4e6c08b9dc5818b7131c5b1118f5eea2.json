"```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT a.element\nFROM bond b\nJOIN connected c ON b.bond_id = c.bond_id\nJOIN atom a ON c.atom_id = a.atom_id\nWHERE b.bond_type = '='\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects distinct elements from the `atom` table that are part of a double type bond, as indicated by `bond_type = '='` in the `bond` table. The query joins the `bond`, `connected`, and `atom` tables using the foreign key relationships to find the relevant atoms."
