"```sql\nSELECT c.Country\nFROM yearmonth ym\nJOIN customers c ON ym.CustomerID = c.CustomerID\nWHERE ym.Consumption = 548.4 AND ym.Date = '201208';\n```\n\nThis SQL query assumes that the \"nationality\" of a customer is represented by the \"Country\" column in the \"customers\" table. The query joins the \"yearmonth\" table with the \"customers\" table using the foreign key relationship and filters the results to find the customer who spent 548.4 in August 2012. Note that the date format '2012/8/24' is represented as '201208' in the \"yearmonth\" table."
