"To answer the question \"What is the percentage of the customers who used EUR in 2012/8/25?\", we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of unique customers who made transactions on '2012-08-25'.\n2. Identify the number of unique customers who used EUR on '2012-08-25'.\n3. Calculate the percentage of customers who used EUR out of the total customers who made transactions on that date.\n\nBased on the database schema, we can use the `transactions_1k` table to find transactions on '2012-08-25' and join it with the `customers` table to filter by currency.\n\nHere's the SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(DISTINCT t.CustomerID) FILTER (WHERE c.Currency = 'EUR') * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT t.CustomerID)) AS percentage_of_customers_using_EUR\nFROM \n  transactions_1k t\nJOIN \n  customers c ON t.CustomerID = c.CustomerID\nWHERE \n  t.Date = '2012-08-25';\n```\n\nThis query calculates the percentage of unique customers who used EUR on '2012-08-25' by dividing the count of distinct customers with EUR currency by the total count of distinct customers who made transactions on that date, and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage."
