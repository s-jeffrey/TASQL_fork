"```sql\nSELECT a.element, COUNT(*)\nFROM atom a\nJOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id\nWHERE m.label = '+'\nAND SUBSTR(a.atom_id, 7, 1) = '4'\nGROUP BY a.element;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `atom` and `molecule` tables to filter out atoms that belong to carcinogenic molecules (where `label = '+'`). It then checks if the atom is the 4th atom of its molecule by examining the 7th character of the `atom_id`. Finally, it groups the results by the `element` and counts the occurrences of each element."
