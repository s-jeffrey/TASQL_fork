"```sql\nSELECT \n    CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN Admission = '+' THEN ID END) AS FLOAT) / \n    COUNT(CASE WHEN Admission = '-' THEN ID END) AS OutpatientToInpatientRatio\nFROM \n    Patient\nWHERE \n    Diagnosis = 'SLE';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the ratio of outpatient to inpatient follow-up treatments among patients diagnosed with 'SLE'. It uses conditional aggregation to count the number of inpatients and outpatients separately and then divides the two counts to get the desired ratio."
