"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT pa.player_api_id)\nFROM Player_Attributes pa\nJOIN Player p ON pa.player_api_id = p.player_api_id\nWHERE strftime('%Y', p.birthday) < '1986'\nAND pa.defensive_work_rate = 'high';\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct players who were born before the year 1986 and have a high defensive work rate, meaning they would remain in their position and defend while the team attacks. The query joins the `Player_Attributes` and `Player` tables using the `player_api_id` to filter the players based on their birth year and defensive work rate."
