"```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT a.frequency\nFROM account a\nJOIN disp d ON a.account_id = d.account_id\nJOIN district di ON a.district_id = di.district_id\nWHERE d.type != 'OWNER'\nAND di.A11 > 8000\nAND di.A11 <= 9000;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects distinct account frequencies from the `account` table where the account type is not 'OWNER' (as 'OWNER' accounts are eligible for loans) and the average salary in the district where the account is located is between $8000 and $9000. The query uses joins to connect the `account`, `disp`, and `district` tables based on the foreign key relationships."
