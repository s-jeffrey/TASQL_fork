"```sql\nSELECT \n    t.CustomerID, \n    SUM(t.Price) / SUM(t.Amount) AS AveragePricePerItem, \n    c.Currency\nFROM \n    transactions_1k t\nJOIN \n    customers c ON t.CustomerID = c.CustomerID\nGROUP BY \n    t.CustomerID, c.Currency\nORDER BY \n    SUM(t.Price) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the top spending customer by summing the `Price` for each `CustomerID` and then dividing by the total `Amount` to get the average price per item. It also retrieves the currency used by this customer. The results are ordered by the total spending in descending order, and the query limits the output to the top customer."
