"```sql\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(id) FILTER (WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1 AND isTextless = 0) * 100.0 / COUNT(id)) AS percentage,\n    id\nFROM \n    cards\nWHERE \n    isStorySpotlight = 1 AND isTextless = 0\nGROUP BY \n    id;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of Story Spotlight cards that do not have a text box and lists them by their ID. It uses a filtered `COUNT` to determine the number of such cards and divides it by the total number of cards to get the percentage. The `GROUP BY id` ensures that the IDs of the relevant cards are listed."
