"To answer the question \"List out the account numbers of clients who are youngest and have highest average salary?\", we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the youngest clients by comparing birth dates.\n2. Determine the highest average salary from the district table.\n3. Join the necessary tables to get the account numbers of these clients.\n\nBased on the database schema, primary keys, and foreign keys, the SQL query can be constructed as follows:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT a.account_id\nFROM account a\nJOIN disp d ON a.account_id = d.account_id\nJOIN client c ON d.client_id = c.client_id\nJOIN district dist ON c.district_id = dist.district_id\nWHERE c.birth_date = (SELECT MAX(c2.birth_date) FROM client c2)\nAND dist.A11 = (SELECT MAX(dist2.A11) FROM district dist2);\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- We join the `account`, `disp`, `client`, and `district` tables to access the necessary columns.\n- We filter clients by the maximum birth date to find the youngest clients.\n- We filter districts by the maximum average salary (A11) to find the highest average salary.\n- We select distinct account IDs to ensure each account number is listed only once."
