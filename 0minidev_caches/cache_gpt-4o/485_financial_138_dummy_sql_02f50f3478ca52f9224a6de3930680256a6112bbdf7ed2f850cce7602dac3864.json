"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM client\nJOIN district ON client.district_id = district.district_id\nWHERE client.gender = 'M'\nAND district.A15 = (\n    SELECT DISTINCT A15\n    FROM district\n    ORDER BY A15 DESC\n    LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1\n);\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of male clients (`gender = 'M'`) in the district where the second-highest number of crimes were committed in 1995 (`A15`). The subquery finds the second-highest value of `A15` by ordering the values in descending order and using `LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1` to skip the highest value."
