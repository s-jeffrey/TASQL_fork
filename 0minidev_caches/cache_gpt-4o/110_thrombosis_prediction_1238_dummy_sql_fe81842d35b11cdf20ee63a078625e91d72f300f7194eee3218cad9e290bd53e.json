"```sql\nSELECT Patient.ID, Patient.SEX\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Examination ON Patient.ID = Examination.ID\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Examination.Diagnosis = 'SLE'\n  AND Laboratory.HGB > 10\n  AND Laboratory.HGB < 17\nORDER BY Patient.Birthday ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the ID and sex of the oldest patient diagnosed with SLE who has a normal hemoglobin level. It joins the `Patient`, `Examination`, and `Laboratory` tables using the foreign key relationships and filters the results based on the diagnosis and hemoglobin level criteria. The results are ordered by the `Birthday` in ascending order to find the oldest patient, and the `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the oldest patient is returned."
