"```sql\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT b.molecule_id) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id)) AS percent\nFROM bond b\nJOIN molecule m ON b.molecule_id = m.molecule_id\nWHERE b.bond_type = '#' AND m.label = '+';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of carcinogenic molecules that have triple bonds. It joins the `bond` and `molecule` tables on the `molecule_id` and filters for triple bonds (`bond_type = '#'`) and carcinogenic molecules (`label = '+'`). The percentage is calculated by dividing the count of distinct carcinogenic molecules with triple bonds by the total count of distinct carcinogenic molecules, then multiplying by 100."
