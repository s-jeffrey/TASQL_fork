"```sql\nSELECT s.School, s.Street\nFROM satscores ss\nJOIN schools s ON ss.cds = s.CDSCode\nORDER BY ss.AvgScrMath DESC\nLIMIT 1 OFFSET 6;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the name and postal street address of the school with the 7th highest average Math score. It joins the `satscores` table with the `schools` table using the foreign key relationship between `satscores.cds` and `schools.CDSCode`. The results are ordered by the average Math score in descending order, and the query retrieves the 7th record using `LIMIT 1 OFFSET 6`."
