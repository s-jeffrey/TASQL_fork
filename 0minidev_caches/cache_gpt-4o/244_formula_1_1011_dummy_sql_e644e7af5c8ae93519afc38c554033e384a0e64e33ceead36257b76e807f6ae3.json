"```sql\nSELECT d.forename, d.surname\nFROM lapTimes lt\nJOIN drivers d ON lt.driverId = d.driverId\nORDER BY lt.milliseconds ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the full name (forename and surname) of the driver who recorded the shortest lap time in a Formula 1 race. It joins the `lapTimes` table with the `drivers` table using the `driverId` foreign key, orders the results by the lap time in milliseconds in ascending order, and limits the result to the top record, which corresponds to the shortest lap time."
