"To answer the question, we need to find the client whose loan was approved first on 1993/7/5, and then calculate the increase rate of their account balance from 1993/3/22 to 1998/12/27. Here's how we can construct the SQL query:\n\n1. Identify the loan approved on 1993/7/5 and get the associated account_id.\n2. Use the account_id to find the corresponding client_id from the disp table.\n3. Use the client_id to find the account balance on the specified dates from the trans table.\n4. Calculate the increase rate using the formula provided in the evidence.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n  ((t2.balance - t1.balance) / t1.balance) * 100 AS increase_rate\nFROM \n  loan l\nJOIN \n  disp d ON l.account_id = d.account_id\nJOIN \n  trans t1 ON d.account_id = t1.account_id AND t1.date = '1993-03-22'\nJOIN \n  trans t2 ON d.account_id = t2.account_id AND t2.date = '1998-12-27'\nWHERE \n  l.date = '1993-07-05'\nORDER BY \n  l.date ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis query does the following:\n- Joins the `loan`, `disp`, and `trans` tables to connect loans to transactions via accounts.\n- Filters for the loan approved on 1993/7/5.\n- Retrieves the balance on 1993/3/22 and 1998/12/27 for the same account.\n- Calculates the increase rate using the provided formula.\n- Orders by the loan approval date to ensure we get the first loan if there are multiple on the same date (though the question specifies only one).\n- Limits the result to one client, as the question implies a single client."
