"```sql\nSELECT m.label\nFROM molecule m\nJOIN bond b ON m.molecule_id = b.molecule_id\nWHERE b.bond_type = '='\nGROUP BY m.molecule_id\nORDER BY COUNT(b.bond_id) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `molecule` and `bond` tables to find the molecule with the most double bonds. It selects the `label` of the molecule, which indicates whether it is carcinogenic (`+`) or not (`-`). The query groups the results by `molecule_id`, counts the number of double bonds for each molecule, orders the results in descending order by the count, and limits the output to the top result."
