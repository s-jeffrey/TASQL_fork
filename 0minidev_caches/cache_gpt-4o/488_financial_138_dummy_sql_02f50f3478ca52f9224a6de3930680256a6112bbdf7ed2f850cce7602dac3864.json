"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM client\nWHERE gender = 'M' AND district_id = (\n    SELECT district_id\n    FROM district\n    ORDER BY A15 DESC\n    LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1\n);\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of male clients (`gender = 'M'`) in the district where the second-highest number of crimes were committed in 1995. The subquery selects the `district_id` of the district with the second-highest number of crimes by ordering the `A15` column in descending order and using `LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1` to skip the highest and select the second-highest."
