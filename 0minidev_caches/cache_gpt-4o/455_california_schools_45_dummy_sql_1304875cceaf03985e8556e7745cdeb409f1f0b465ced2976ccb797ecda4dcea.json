"```sql\nSELECT s.School, sat.AvgScrWrite\nFROM schools s\nJOIN satscores sat ON s.CDSCode = sat.cds\nWHERE s.AdmFName1 = 'Ricci' AND s.AdmLName1 = 'Ulrich';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the school names and their corresponding average writing scores from the `satscores` table for schools managed by an administrator named Ricci Ulrich. It uses a join between the `schools` and `satscores` tables based on the foreign key relationship between `CDSCode` in `schools` and `cds` in `satscores`."
