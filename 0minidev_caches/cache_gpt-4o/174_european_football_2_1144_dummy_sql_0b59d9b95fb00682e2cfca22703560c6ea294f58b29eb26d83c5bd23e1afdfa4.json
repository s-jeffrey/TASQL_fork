"```sql\nSELECT pa.finishing, pa.curve\nFROM Player p\nJOIN Player_Attributes pa ON p.player_api_id = pa.player_api_id\nWHERE p.weight = (SELECT MAX(weight) FROM Player);\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the finishing rate and curve score of the player with the heaviest weight. It joins the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables using the `player_api_id` and filters the results to find the player with the maximum weight."
