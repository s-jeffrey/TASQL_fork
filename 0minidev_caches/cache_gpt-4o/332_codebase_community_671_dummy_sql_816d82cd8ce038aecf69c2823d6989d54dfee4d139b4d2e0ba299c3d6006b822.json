"```sql\nSELECT users.DisplayName\nFROM badges\nJOIN users ON badges.UserId = users.Id\nWHERE badges.Name = 'Autobiographer'\nORDER BY badges.Date ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the display name of the user who acquired the first \"Autobiographer\" badge by joining the `badges` and `users` tables on the `UserId`. It filters for badges with the name \"Autobiographer\", orders the results by the `Date` in ascending order to find the earliest acquisition, and limits the result to the first entry."
