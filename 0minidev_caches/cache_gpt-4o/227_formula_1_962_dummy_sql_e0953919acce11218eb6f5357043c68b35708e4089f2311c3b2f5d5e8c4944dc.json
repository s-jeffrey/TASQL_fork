"To answer the question, we need to calculate the percentage of drivers who meet the specified conditions. Here's the SQL query that accomplishes this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(DISTINCT r.driverId) * 100.0 / \n    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT driverId) \n     FROM results \n     JOIN races ON results.raceId = races.raceId \n     WHERE races.year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2005)) AS percentage\nFROM \n    results r\nJOIN \n    drivers d ON r.driverId = d.driverId\nJOIN \n    races ra ON r.raceId = ra.raceId\nWHERE \n    YEAR(d.dob) < 1985 \n    AND ra.year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2005 \n    AND r.laps > 50;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Subquery**: The subquery calculates the total number of distinct drivers who participated in races between 2000 and 2005.\n- **Main Query**: The main query counts the distinct drivers who were born before 1985 and participated in races with more than 50 laps during the same period.\n- **Percentage Calculation**: The main query's count is divided by the subquery's count and multiplied by 100 to get the percentage."
