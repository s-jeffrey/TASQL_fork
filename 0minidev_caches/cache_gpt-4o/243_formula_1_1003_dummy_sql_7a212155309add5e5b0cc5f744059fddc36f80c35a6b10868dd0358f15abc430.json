"To answer the question about the number of accidents for the driver with the highest number of accidents in the Canadian Grand Prix, we need to construct an SQL query that joins the relevant tables and filters based on the conditions provided. Here's how you can write the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT MAX(accident_count) AS max_accidents\nFROM (\n    SELECT d.driverId, COUNT(*) AS accident_count\n    FROM results r\n    JOIN races ra ON r.raceId = ra.raceId\n    JOIN status s ON r.statusId = s.statusId\n    JOIN drivers d ON r.driverId = d.driverId\n    WHERE ra.name = 'Canadian Grand Prix' AND s.status = 'Accident'\n    GROUP BY d.driverId\n) AS driver_accidents;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Tables Involved**: \n  - `results`: To get the status of each driver in each race.\n  - `races`: To filter the specific race, i.e., Canadian Grand Prix.\n  - `status`: To identify the status of \"Accident\" using `statusId`.\n  - `drivers`: To group the accidents by each driver.\n\n- **Conditions**:\n  - We filter the races to only include the \"Canadian Grand Prix\".\n  - We filter the results to only include those with a status of \"Accident\".\n\n- **Aggregation**:\n  - We count the number of accidents for each driver in the Canadian Grand Prix.\n  - We then select the maximum count of accidents from the grouped results to find the driver with the highest number of accidents."
