"```sql\nSELECT \n  p.SEX, \n  GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT l.ID) AS PatientIDs\nFROM \n  Patient p\nJOIN \n  Laboratory l ON p.ID = l.ID\nWHERE \n  l.`T-BIL` >= 2.0\nGROUP BY \n  p.SEX;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the sex of patients and groups their IDs for those whose total bilirubin (T-BIL) level is not within the normal range (i.e., T-BIL >= 2.0). It uses a join between the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on the patient ID, and groups the results by the sex of the patients."
