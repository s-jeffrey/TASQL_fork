"```sql\nSELECT player_name\nFROM Player\nJOIN Player_Attributes ON Player.player_api_id = Player_Attributes.player_api_id\nWHERE height = (SELECT MAX(height) FROM Player) OR height = (SELECT MIN(height) FROM Player)\nGROUP BY player_name\nORDER BY AVG(finishing) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query finds the player with the highest average finishing rate among the tallest and shortest players. It joins the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables, filters for the tallest and shortest players, groups by player name, and orders by the average finishing rate in descending order, returning the top result."
