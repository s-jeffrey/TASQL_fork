"```sql\nSELECT name\nFROM cards\nWHERE name IN ('Serra Angel', 'Shrine Keeper')\nORDER BY convertedManaCost DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the name of the card with the higher converted mana cost between \"Serra Angel\" and \"Shrine Keeper\". It orders the results by `convertedManaCost` in descending order and limits the output to the top result, which will be the card with the higher cost."
