"```sql\nSELECT c.name, c.artist, c.isPromo\nFROM cards c\nJOIN rulings r ON c.uuid = r.uuid\nGROUP BY c.name, c.artist, c.isPromo\nORDER BY COUNT(r.uuid) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the name and artist of the card with the most ruling information, as well as whether the card is a promotional printing. It joins the `cards` and `rulings` tables using the `uuid` foreign key relationship, groups the results by card name, artist, and promotional status, and orders them by the count of rulings in descending order to find the card with the most rulings. The `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the top result is returned."
