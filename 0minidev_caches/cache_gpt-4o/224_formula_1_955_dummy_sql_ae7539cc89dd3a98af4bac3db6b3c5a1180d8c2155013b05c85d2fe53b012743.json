"```sql\nSELECT r.year, AVG(TIME_TO_SEC(STR_TO_DATE(SUBSTRING(res.time, 1, 8), '%H:%i:%s'))) AS average_champion_time_seconds\nFROM results res\nJOIN races r ON res.raceId = r.raceId\nWHERE res.positionOrder = 1 AND res.time IS NOT NULL AND r.year < 1975\nGROUP BY r.year;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the average time in seconds for the champion (positionOrder = 1) for each year before 1975. It joins the `results` and `races` tables using the `raceId` foreign key, filters for races where the champion's time is not null, and converts the time from the format 'HH:MM:SS.mmm' to seconds using `TIME_TO_SEC` and `STR_TO_DATE` functions. The results are grouped by year."
