"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e.ID)\nFROM Examination e\nJOIN Laboratory l ON e.ID = l.ID\nWHERE l.CPK < 250\nAND (e.KCT = '+' OR e.RVVT = '+' OR e.LAC = '+');\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct patients who have a normal range of creatinine phosphokinase (CPK < 250) and a positive measure of degree of coagulation (KCT, RVVT, or LAC is '+'). The query joins the `Examination` and `Laboratory` tables on the patient ID to ensure that the conditions are checked for the same patient."
