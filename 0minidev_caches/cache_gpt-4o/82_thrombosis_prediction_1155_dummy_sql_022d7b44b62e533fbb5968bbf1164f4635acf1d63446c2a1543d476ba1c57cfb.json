"```sql\nSELECT Patient.ID, Patient.SEX, Patient.Birthday\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Laboratory.LDH > 500;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the patient ID, sex, and birthday from the `Patient` table for patients whose LDH levels in the `Laboratory` table are beyond the normal range, specifically greater than 500. The query uses a JOIN operation to connect the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on the patient ID, which is a foreign key relationship."
