"```sql\nSELECT County, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfSchools\nFROM schools\nWHERE Virtual = 'F' AND County IN ('San Diego', 'Santa Barbara')\nGROUP BY County\nORDER BY NumberOfSchools DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the county with the most number of schools that do not offer a physical building (where `Virtual = 'F'`) between San Diego and Santa Barbara. It counts the number of such schools in each county, orders the results by the count in descending order, and limits the output to the top result."
