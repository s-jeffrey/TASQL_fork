It uses the `loan`, `disp`, and `client` tables, joining them on the appropriate foreign keys. The query filters for male clients and calculates the sum of loan amounts for the years 1996 and 1997, then computes the growth rate using the formula provided in the evidence. The `NULLIF` function is used to prevent division by zero."
