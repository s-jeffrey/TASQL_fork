"```sql\nSELECT Birthday\nFROM Patient\nWHERE ID IN (\n    SELECT ID\n    FROM Laboratory\n    WHERE GOT >= 60\n)\nORDER BY Birthday DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the birthday of the youngest patient who has an abnormal level of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT >= 60). It does this by first identifying the patients with abnormal GOT levels in the Laboratory table, then finding their corresponding birthdays in the Patient table, and finally ordering the results to get the youngest patient."
