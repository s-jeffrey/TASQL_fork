"```sql\nSELECT \n    (SUM(CASE WHEN m.label = '+' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(b.bond_id)) AS proportion_of_single_bonds_carcinogenic\nFROM \n    bond b\nJOIN \n    molecule m ON b.molecule_id = m.molecule_id\nWHERE \n    b.bond_type = '-';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the proportion of single bonds that are carcinogenic. It joins the `bond` table with the `molecule` table using the `molecule_id` foreign key relationship. It filters for single bonds (`bond_type = '-'`) and counts how many of these bonds are in molecules labeled as carcinogenic (`label = '+'`). The result is expressed as a percentage with five decimal places."
