"```sql\nSELECT d.driverId, d.code\nFROM drivers d\nJOIN results r ON d.driverId = r.driverId\nWHERE YEAR(d.dob) = 1971 AND r.fastestLapTime IS NOT NULL;\n```\nThis SQL query selects the `driverId` and `code` of drivers who were born in 1971 and have a recorded fastest lap time in any race. It joins the `drivers` table with the `results` table using the `driverId` as the foreign key. The condition `YEAR(d.dob) = 1971` filters drivers born in 1971, and `r.fastestLapTime IS NOT NULL` ensures that only drivers with a recorded fastest lap time are included."
