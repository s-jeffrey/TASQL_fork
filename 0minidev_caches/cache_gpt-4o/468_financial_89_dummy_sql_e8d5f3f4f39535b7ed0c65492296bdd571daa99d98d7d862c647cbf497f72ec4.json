"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM account\nJOIN district ON account.district_id = district.district_id\nWHERE account.frequency = 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU'\nAND district.A3 = 'east Bohemia';\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of accounts that have chosen the frequency 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' (issuance after transaction) and are located in the East Bohemia region. The query joins the `account` table with the `district` table using the `district_id` foreign key to filter accounts based on the region specified in the `A3` column of the `district` table."
