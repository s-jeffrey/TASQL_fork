"```sql\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(p.Id) FILTER (WHERE t.TagName = 'r')::float / COUNT(p.Id) FILTER (WHERE u.DisplayName = 'Community')) * 100 AS percentage\nFROM \n    posts p\nJOIN \n    users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id\nJOIN \n    tags t ON t.ExcerptPostId = p.Id\nWHERE \n    u.DisplayName = 'Community';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of posts that use the R language (indicated by the tag name 'r') among all posts made by the user with the display name 'Community'. It uses a `JOIN` operation to connect the `posts`, `users`, and `tags` tables based on the foreign key relationships defined in the schema. The `FILTER` clause is used to count only the relevant posts for the numerator and denominator."
