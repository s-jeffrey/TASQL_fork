"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT L.ID)\nFROM Patient P\nJOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID\nWHERE P.SEX = 'M'\n  AND L.WBC > 3.5 AND L.WBC < 9.0\n  AND (L.FG <= 150 OR L.FG >= 450);\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct male patients (`P.SEX = 'M'`) who have a normal white blood cell count (`L.WBC > 3.5 AND L.WBC < 9.0`) and an abnormal fibrinogen level (`L.FG <= 150 OR L.FG >= 450`). The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that each patient is only counted once, even if they have multiple laboratory records meeting the criteria."
