"```sql\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE setCode = 'CSP')) AS percentage\nFROM \n    cards\nWHERE \n    convertedManaCost = 7 AND setCode = 'CSP';\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The query calculates the percentage of cards with a converted mana cost of 7 in the set \"Coldsnap\".\n- The `setCode` for \"Coldsnap\" is assumed to be 'CSP' based on typical Magic: The Gathering set codes.\n- The query counts the number of cards with `convertedManaCost = 7` in the specified set and divides it by the total number of cards in the same set, multiplying by 100 to get the percentage."
