"To answer the question \"Among the account opened, how many female customers who were born before 1950 and stayed in Sokolov?\", we need to join several tables based on the foreign key relationships and apply the necessary filters. Here's the SQL query that accomplishes this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM client\nJOIN disp ON client.client_id = disp.client_id\nJOIN account ON disp.account_id = account.account_id\nJOIN district ON client.district_id = district.district_id\nWHERE client.gender = 'F'\n  AND client.birth_date < '1950-01-01'\n  AND district.A2 = 'Sokolov';\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Tables Involved**: \n  - `client`: To filter by gender and birth date.\n  - `disp`: To link clients to accounts.\n  - `account`: To ensure we are considering only opened accounts.\n  - `district`: To filter by the district name \"Sokolov\".\n\n- **Joins**:\n  - `client` is joined with `disp` using `client_id` to find the disposition records for each client.\n  - `disp` is joined with `account` using `account_id` to find the accounts associated with each disposition.\n  - `client` is joined with `district` using `district_id` to filter clients based on their district.\n\n- **Filters**:\n  - `client.gender = 'F'`: To select only female clients.\n  - `client.birth_date < '1950-01-01'`: To select clients born before 1950.\n  - `district.A2 = 'Sokolov'`: To select clients residing in the district named \"Sokolov\".\n\nThis query will return the count of female clients who meet the specified criteria."
