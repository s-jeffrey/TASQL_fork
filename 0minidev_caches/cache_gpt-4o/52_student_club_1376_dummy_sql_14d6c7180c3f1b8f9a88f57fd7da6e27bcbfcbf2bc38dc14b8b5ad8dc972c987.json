"```sql\nSELECT e.event_name\nFROM event e\nJOIN budget b ON e.event_id = b.link_to_event\nWHERE e.status = 'Closed'\nORDER BY (b.spent / b.amount) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the event name from the `event` table, joining it with the `budget` table to calculate the spend-to-budget ratio for closed events. It orders the results by the ratio in descending order and limits the output to the top result, which corresponds to the event with the highest spend-to-budget ratio."
