"```sql\nSELECT \n  (SUM(CASE WHEN Date LIKE '1981-11-%' THEN T-CHO ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN Date LIKE '1981-12-%' THEN T-CHO ELSE 0 END)) / \n  NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN Date LIKE '1981-12-%' THEN T-CHO ELSE 0 END), 0) AS decrease_rate\nFROM \n  Laboratory\nJOIN \n  Patient ON Laboratory.ID = Patient.ID\nWHERE \n  Patient.Birthday = '1959-02-18';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the decrease rate of total cholesterol (T-CHO) for a patient born on February 18, 1959, from November to December 1981. It uses a JOIN to connect the Laboratory and Patient tables based on the patient ID, and it filters the records by the specified birthday. The calculation involves subtracting the total cholesterol sum for December from that of November and dividing by the December sum, ensuring no division by zero with `NULLIF`."
