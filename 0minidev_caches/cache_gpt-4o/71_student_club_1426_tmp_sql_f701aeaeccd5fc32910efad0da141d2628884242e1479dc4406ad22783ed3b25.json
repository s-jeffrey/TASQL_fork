"To convert the given SR (Structured Representation) into an executable SQL query, we need to follow the logic described in the SR and ensure it aligns with the schema and question requirements. The SR indicates filtering the data based on the major name \"Environmental Engineering\" and then selecting specific columns. Here's how the SQL query should be constructed:\n\n1. **Filter**: We need to filter the records where the `major_name` is \"Environmental Engineering\".\n2. **Select**: We need to select the `last_name` of members, along with the `department` and `college` associated with the major.\n\nGiven the schema and foreign key relationships, we need to join the `member` and `major` tables using the `link_to_major` and `major_id` columns.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT member.last_name, major.department, major.college\nFROM member\nINNER JOIN major ON member.link_to_major = major.major_id\nWHERE major.major_name = 'Environmental Engineering';\n```\n\nThis query will list the last names of members who have a major in Environmental Engineering, along with the department and college name associated with that major."
