"```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT c.frameVersion, c.name\nFROM cards c\nJOIN legalities l ON c.uuid = l.uuid\nWHERE c.artist = 'Allen Williams'\n   OR l.status = 'banned';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects distinct frame styles (`frameVersion`) and card names (`name`) from the `cards` table. It joins the `cards` table with the `legalities` table using the `uuid` foreign key relationship. The query filters for cards where the artist is 'Allen Williams' or where the card's status is 'banned'."
