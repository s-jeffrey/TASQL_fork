"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Patient.ID)\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE YEAR(Patient.Birthday) BETWEEN 1936 AND 1956\n  AND Patient.SEX = 'M'\n  AND Laboratory.CPK >= 250;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct male patients born between 1936 and 1956 who have creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels beyond the normal range (greater than or equal to 250). The query joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables using the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship."
