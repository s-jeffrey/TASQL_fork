"To answer the question \"For the user with the display name of 'Tiago Pasqualini', how many posts did he/she own?\", we need to join the `users` table with the `posts` table using the foreign key relationship between `users.Id` and `posts.OwnerUserId`. We will then filter the results by the `DisplayName` of the user and count the number of posts owned by that user.\n\nHere's the SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS PostCount\nFROM users\nJOIN posts ON users.Id = posts.OwnerUserId\nWHERE users.DisplayName = 'Tiago Pasqualini';\n```\n\nThis query will return the number of posts owned by the user with the display name \"Tiago Pasqualini\"."
