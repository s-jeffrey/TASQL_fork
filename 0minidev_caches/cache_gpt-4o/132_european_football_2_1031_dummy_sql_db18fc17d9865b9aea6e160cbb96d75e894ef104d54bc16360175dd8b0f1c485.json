"```sql\nSELECT Player.player_name, \n       (strftime('%Y', 'now') - strftime('%Y', Player.birthday)) - \n       (strftime('%m-%d', 'now') < strftime('%m-%d', Player.birthday)) AS age\nFROM Player\nJOIN Player_Attributes ON Player.player_api_id = Player_Attributes.player_api_id\nWHERE Player_Attributes.sprint_speed >= 97\n  AND strftime('%Y', Player_Attributes.date) BETWEEN '2013' AND '2015';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the current age of players who had a sprint speed of no less than 97 between the years 2013 and 2015. It joins the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables using the `player_api_id` and filters the results based on the sprint speed and the date range. The age is calculated by subtracting the player's birth year from the current year and adjusting for whether the player's birthday has occurred this year."
