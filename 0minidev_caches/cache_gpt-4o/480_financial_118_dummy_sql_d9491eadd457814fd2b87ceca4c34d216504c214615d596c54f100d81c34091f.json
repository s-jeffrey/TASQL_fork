"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(DISTINCT loan.account_id) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT account.account_id)) AS percentage_running_ok\nFROM \n  loan\nJOIN \n  account ON loan.account_id = account.account_id\nWHERE \n  loan.amount < 100000 AND loan.status = 'C';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of accounts with a loan amount less than USD 100,000 that are still running with no issues (status 'C'). It joins the `loan` and `account` tables on `account_id` and filters the loans based on the specified conditions. The result is the percentage of such accounts."
