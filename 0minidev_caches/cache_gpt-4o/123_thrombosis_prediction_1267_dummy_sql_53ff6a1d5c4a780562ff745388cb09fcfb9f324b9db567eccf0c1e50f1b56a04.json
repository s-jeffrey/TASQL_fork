"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM Examination\nJOIN Laboratory ON Examination.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE (Laboratory.SM = 'negative' OR Laboratory.SM = '0')\n  AND Examination.Thrombosis = 0;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of patients who have a normal anti-SM test result and do not have thrombosis. The query joins the `Examination` and `Laboratory` tables on the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship. It then filters for records where the `SM` column in the `Laboratory` table is either 'negative' or '0', indicating a normal anti-SM result, and where the `Thrombosis` column in the `Examination` table is 0, indicating no thrombosis."
