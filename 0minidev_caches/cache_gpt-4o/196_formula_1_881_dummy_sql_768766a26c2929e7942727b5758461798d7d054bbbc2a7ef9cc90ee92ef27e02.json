"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(driverId) FILTER (WHERE time IS NOT NULL) * 100.0 / COUNT(driverId)) AS completion_rate\nFROM \n  results\nJOIN \n  races ON results.raceId = races.raceId\nWHERE \n  races.date = '1983-07-16';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the race completion rate for drivers who participated in the race on July 16, 1983. It does this by dividing the count of drivers who have a non-null `time` value (indicating they completed the race) by the total count of drivers who participated in the race, and then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage."
