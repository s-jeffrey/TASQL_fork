"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM attendance\nJOIN event ON attendance.link_to_event = event.event_id\nJOIN member ON attendance.link_to_member = member.member_id\nWHERE event.event_name = 'Women''s Soccer' AND member.t_shirt_size = 'Medium';\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of students who attended the event named \"Women's Soccer\" and want a T-shirt in medium size. It uses the `attendance` table to find the link between events and members, joins with the `event` table to filter by the event name, and joins with the `member` table to filter by T-shirt size."
