"To answer the question, we need to generate an SQL query that considers the conditions specified in the question and the evidence provided. Here's how we can construct the SQL query:\n\n1. We need to find non-chartered schools, which means `Charter = 0`.\n2. We are interested in schools located in Los Angeles County.\n3. We need to calculate the percentage of eligible free meals for grades 1 through 12 and ensure it is less than 0.18%.\n4. We will join the `frpm` and `schools` tables using the foreign key relationship.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM frpm\nJOIN schools ON frpm.CDSCode = schools.CDSCode\nWHERE schools.County = 'Los Angeles'\n  AND schools.Charter = 0\n  AND (frpm.[Free Meal Count (K-12)] * 100.0 / frpm.[Enrollment (K-12)]) < 0.18;\n```\n\nThis query counts the number of non-chartered schools in Los Angeles County where the percentage of eligible free meals for grades 1 through 12 is less than 0.18%."
