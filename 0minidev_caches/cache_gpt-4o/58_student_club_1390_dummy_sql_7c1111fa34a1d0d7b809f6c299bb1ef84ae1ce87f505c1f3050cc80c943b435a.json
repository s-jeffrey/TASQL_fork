"```sql\nSELECT \n    (SUM(e.cost) FILTER (WHERE ev.event_name = 'Yearly Kickoff') / SUM(e.cost)) * 100 AS percentage\nFROM \n    expense e\nJOIN \n    budget b ON e.link_to_budget = b.budget_id\nJOIN \n    event ev ON b.link_to_event = ev.event_id;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of the total cost that is attributed to the \"Yearly Kickoff\" event. It uses a `JOIN` to connect the `expense`, `budget`, and `event` tables based on their foreign key relationships, and then applies a filter to sum the costs specifically for the \"Yearly Kickoff\" event. The result is divided by the total cost of all events to get the percentage."
