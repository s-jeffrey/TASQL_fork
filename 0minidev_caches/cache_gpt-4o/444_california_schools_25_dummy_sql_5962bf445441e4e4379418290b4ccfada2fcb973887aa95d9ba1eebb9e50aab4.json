"```sql\nSELECT s.School, s.FundingType\nFROM satscores ss\nJOIN schools s ON ss.cds = s.CDSCode\nWHERE s.County = 'Riverside'\nGROUP BY s.School, s.FundingType\nHAVING AVG(ss.AvgScrMath) > 400;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the names and funding types of schools located in Riverside County where the average of the average math scores for the SAT is greater than 400. It uses a join between the `satscores` and `schools` tables based on the foreign key relationship, groups the results by school and funding type, and applies the condition on the average math score."
