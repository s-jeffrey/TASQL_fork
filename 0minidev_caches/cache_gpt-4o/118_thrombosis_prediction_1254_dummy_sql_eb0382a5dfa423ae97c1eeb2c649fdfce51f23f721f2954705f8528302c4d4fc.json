"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Patient.ID)\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Laboratory.IGA > 80\n  AND Laboratory.IGA < 500\n  AND Patient.`First Date` >= '1990-01-01';\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct patients who have a normal Ig A level and came to the hospital after January 1, 1990. It uses a join between the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship. The conditions for a normal Ig A level and the date of the first hospital visit are applied in the `WHERE` clause."
