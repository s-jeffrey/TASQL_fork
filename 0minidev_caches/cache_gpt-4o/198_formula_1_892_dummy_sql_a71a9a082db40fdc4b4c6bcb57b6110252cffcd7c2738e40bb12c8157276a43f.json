"```sql\nSELECT d.forename, d.surname, ds.points\nFROM driverStandings ds\nJOIN drivers d ON ds.driverId = d.driverId\nWHERE ds.points = (\n  SELECT MAX(points)\n  FROM driverStandings\n);\n```\nThis SQL query retrieves the full name (forename and surname) of the driver who scored the most points, along with the points they scored. It uses a subquery to find the maximum points scored in the `driverStandings` table and then joins this result with the `drivers` table to get the full name of the driver."
