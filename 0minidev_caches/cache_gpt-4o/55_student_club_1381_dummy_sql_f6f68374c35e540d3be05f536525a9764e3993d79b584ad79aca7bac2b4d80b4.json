"```sql\nSELECT CONCAT(m.first_name, ' ', m.last_name) AS full_name\nFROM member m\nJOIN attendance a ON m.member_id = a.link_to_member\nGROUP BY m.member_id\nHAVING COUNT(a.link_to_event) > 7;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the full names of students who have attended more than 7 events. It joins the `member` and `attendance` tables using the foreign key relationship between `member_id` and `link_to_member`. The query groups the results by `member_id` and filters the groups to include only those with a count of `link_to_event` greater than 7."
