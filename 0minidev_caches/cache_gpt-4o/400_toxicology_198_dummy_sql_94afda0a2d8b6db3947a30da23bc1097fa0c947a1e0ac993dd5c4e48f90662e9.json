"```sql\nSELECT AVG(single_bond_count) \nFROM (\n    SELECT m.molecule_id, COUNT(b.bond_id) AS single_bond_count\n    FROM molecule m\n    JOIN bond b ON m.molecule_id = b.molecule_id\n    WHERE m.label = '+' AND b.bond_type = '-'\n    GROUP BY m.molecule_id\n) AS carcinogenic_single_bonds;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the average number of single bonds in carcinogenic molecules. It first joins the `molecule` and `bond` tables to filter out only those molecules that are carcinogenic (where `label = '+'`) and have single bonds (where `bond_type = '-'`). It then counts the number of single bonds for each carcinogenic molecule and calculates the average of these counts."
