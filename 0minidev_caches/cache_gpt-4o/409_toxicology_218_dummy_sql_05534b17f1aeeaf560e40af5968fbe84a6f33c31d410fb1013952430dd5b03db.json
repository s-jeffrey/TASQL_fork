"```sql\nSELECT \n    100.0 * (\n        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id)\n        FROM molecule m\n        LEFT JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id\n        WHERE m.label = '+' AND a.element = 'f'\n    ) / COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id) AS percentage\nFROM molecule m\nWHERE m.label = '+';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of carcinogenic-type molecules that do not contain fluorine. It first counts the distinct molecule IDs of carcinogenic molecules that contain fluorine and then divides this by the total count of distinct carcinogenic molecule IDs, subtracting the result from 100 to get the percentage of those that do not contain fluorine."
