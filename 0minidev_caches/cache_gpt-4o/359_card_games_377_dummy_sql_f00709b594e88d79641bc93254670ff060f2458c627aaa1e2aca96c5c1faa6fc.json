"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM cards\nWHERE originalType = 'Summon - Angel'\nAND subtypes IS NOT NULL\nAND subtypes NOT LIKE '%Angel%';\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of cards in the `cards` table where the `originalType` is \"Summon - Angel\" and the `subtypes` column does not include \"Angel\". The condition `subtypes IS NOT NULL` ensures that only cards with defined subtypes are considered."
