"```sql\nSELECT P.player_name\nFROM Player P\nJOIN Player_Attributes PA ON P.player_fifa_api_id = PA.player_fifa_api_id\nWHERE P.height > 180\nGROUP BY P.player_name\nORDER BY AVG(PA.heading_accuracy) DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables using the `player_fifa_api_id` as the foreign key. It filters players with a height greater than 180 cm, groups the results by player name, and orders them by the average heading accuracy in descending order. Finally, it limits the results to the top 10 players."
