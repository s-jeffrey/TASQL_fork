"```sql\nSELECT GSoffered\nFROM schools\nORDER BY ABS(Longitude) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the grade span offered (`GSoffered`) from the `schools` table, ordering the results by the absolute value of the `Longitude` in descending order to find the school with the highest longitude. It limits the result to the top entry, which corresponds to the school with the maximum absolute longitude value."
