"```sql\nSELECT drivers.url\nFROM lapTimes\nJOIN drivers ON lapTimes.driverId = drivers.driverId\nWHERE lapTimes.raceId = 161 AND lapTimes.time LIKE '1:27%';\n```\nThis SQL query retrieves the introduction website (URL) of the driver who achieved a lap time of 1:27 in race number 161. It uses a JOIN operation to connect the `lapTimes` table with the `drivers` table based on the `driverId`, and filters the results to match the specified race ID and lap time pattern."
