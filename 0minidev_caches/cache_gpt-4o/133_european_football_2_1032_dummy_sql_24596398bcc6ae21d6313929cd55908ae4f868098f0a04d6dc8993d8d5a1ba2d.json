"```sql\nSELECT L.name, COUNT(M.id) AS match_count\nFROM Match M\nJOIN League L ON M.league_id = L.id\nGROUP BY L.name\nORDER BY match_count DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `Match` and `League` tables to count the number of matches played in each league. It then orders the results by the match count in descending order and limits the output to the league with the highest number of matches."
