"```sql\nSELECT Patient.ID, \n       YEAR(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) - YEAR(Patient.Birthday) AS age\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Examination ON Patient.ID = Examination.ID\nWHERE Examination.RVVT = '+';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the `ID` and calculates the `age` of patients from the `Patient` table who have a positive degree of coagulation, as indicated by the `RVVT` column in the `Examination` table. The `JOIN` operation is used to link the `Patient` and `Examination` tables based on the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship. The `age` is calculated by subtracting the year of the `Birthday` from the current year."
