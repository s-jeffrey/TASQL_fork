"```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT g.Country\nFROM transactions_1k t\nJOIN gasstations g ON t.GasStationID = g.GasStationID\nJOIN yearmonth ym ON t.CustomerID = ym.CustomerID\nWHERE ym.Date = '201306';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects distinct countries of gas stations where transactions took place in June 2013. It joins the `transactions_1k` table with the `gasstations` table to get the country information and uses the `yearmonth` table to filter transactions that occurred in June 2013."
