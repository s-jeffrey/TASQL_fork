"```sql\nSELECT c.Text, c.UserDisplayName\nFROM comments c\nJOIN posts p ON c.PostId = p.Id\nWHERE p.Title = 'Analysing wind data with R'\nORDER BY c.CreationDate DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the text and user display name of the latest 10 comments on a post with the specified title. It joins the `comments` and `posts` tables using the `PostId` foreign key and orders the results by the `CreationDate` in descending order to get the most recent comments."
