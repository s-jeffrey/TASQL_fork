"To answer the question about the percentage of the \"Premium\" segment against the overall segment in the country \"SVK\", we need to query the `gasstations` table. Here's how you can construct the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(CASE WHEN Segment = 'Premium' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS Premium_Percentage\nFROM \n    gasstations\nWHERE \n    Country = 'SVK';\n```\n\nThis query calculates the percentage of gas stations in the \"Premium\" segment within the country \"SVK\" by counting the number of \"Premium\" entries and dividing by the total number of entries for that country, then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage."
