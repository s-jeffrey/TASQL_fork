"```sql\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(DISTINCT b.molecule_id) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT b_all.molecule_id)) AS percent\nFROM \n    bond b\nJOIN \n    molecule m ON b.molecule_id = m.molecule_id\nJOIN \n    bond b_all ON b_all.molecule_id = m.molecule_id\nWHERE \n    b.bond_type = '#' AND m.label = '+'\n```\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of carcinogenic molecules that have triple type bonds. It first filters the bonds to only those that are triple type (`bond_type = '#'`) and then checks if the corresponding molecule is carcinogenic (`label = '+'`). The percentage is calculated by dividing the count of distinct carcinogenic molecules with triple bonds by the total count of distinct molecules with triple bonds, multiplied by 100."
