"```sql\nSELECT circuits.name AS circuit_name, races.year, results.fastestLapTime\nFROM circuits\nJOIN races ON races.circuitId = circuits.circuitId\nJOIN results ON results.raceId = races.raceId\nWHERE circuits.country = 'Italy'\nAND results.fastestLapTime IS NOT NULL\nORDER BY circuits.name, races.year;\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the lap records (fastest lap times) for circuits located in Italy. It joins the `circuits`, `races`, and `results` tables to find the relevant data, ensuring that only circuits in Italy are considered and that the fastest lap time is not null. The results are ordered by circuit name and year."
