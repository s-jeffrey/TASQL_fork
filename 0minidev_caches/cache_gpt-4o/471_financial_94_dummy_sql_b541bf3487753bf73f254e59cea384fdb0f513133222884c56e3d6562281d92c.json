The first query retrieves the account numbers of the oldest female clients who have the lowest average salary. It joins the necessary tables (`account`, `disp`, `client`, and `district`) and applies the conditions for gender, birth date, and average salary.\n\n2. The second query calculates the gap between the highest and lowest average salaries in the `district` table."
