"```sql\nSELECT d.forename, d.surname\nFROM results r\nJOIN drivers d ON r.driverId = d.driverId\nWHERE r.raceId = 592 AND r.time IS NOT NULL\nORDER BY d.dob ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the forename and surname of the oldest driver who finished the race with raceId 592. It joins the `results` table with the `drivers` table using the `driverId` foreign key, filters for non-null `time` values to ensure the driver finished the race, and orders the results by date of birth (`dob`) in ascending order to find the oldest driver. The `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the oldest driver is returned."
