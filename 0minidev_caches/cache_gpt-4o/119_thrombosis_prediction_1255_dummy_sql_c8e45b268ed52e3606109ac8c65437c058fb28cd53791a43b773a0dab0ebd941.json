"```sql\nSELECT p.Diagnosis\nFROM Patient p\nJOIN Laboratory l ON p.ID = l.ID\nWHERE l.IGM <= 40 OR l.IGM >= 400\nGROUP BY p.Diagnosis\nORDER BY COUNT(p.Diagnosis) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables using the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship. It filters for patients with an abnormal Ig M level (Ig M <= 40 or Ig M >= 400) and groups the results by the `Diagnosis` column from the `Patient` table. It then orders the results by the count of each diagnosis in descending order and limits the output to the most common diagnosis."
