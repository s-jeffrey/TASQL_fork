"```sql\nSELECT d.forename, d.surname\nFROM results r\nJOIN drivers d ON r.driverId = d.driverId\nWHERE r.raceId = 872 AND r.time IS NOT NULL\nORDER BY d.dob DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the forename and surname of the youngest driver who finished the race with `raceId` 872. It joins the `results` table with the `drivers` table using the `driverId` foreign key, filters for drivers who have a non-null `time` (indicating they finished the race), and orders the results by date of birth (`dob`) in descending order to find the youngest driver. The `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the youngest driver is returned."
