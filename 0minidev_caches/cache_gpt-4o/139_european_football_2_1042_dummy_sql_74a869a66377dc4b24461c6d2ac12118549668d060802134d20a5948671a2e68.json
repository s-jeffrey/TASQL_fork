"```sql\nSELECT League.name\nFROM Match\nJOIN League ON Match.league_id = League.id\nWHERE Match.season = '2009/2010'\nGROUP BY League.name\nHAVING AVG(Match.home_team_goal) > AVG(Match.away_team_goal);\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the names of leagues where the average number of goals scored by the home team is greater than the average number of goals scored by the away team during the 2009/2010 season. It uses a `JOIN` to connect the `Match` table with the `League` table based on the `league_id`, filters the matches to only include those from the 2009/2010 season, and groups the results by league name to calculate the average goals for home and away teams."
