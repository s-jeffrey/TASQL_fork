"```sql\nSELECT \n    (SELECT COUNT(posts.Id) FROM posts WHERE posts.OwnerUserId = 24) / \n    (SELECT COUNT(votes.Id) FROM votes WHERE votes.UserId = 24) AS PostToVoteRatio;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the ratio of the number of posts to the number of votes for the user with `UserId` 24. It uses two subqueries: one to count the posts where the `OwnerUserId` is 24 and another to count the votes where the `UserId` is 24. The result is the division of these two counts, giving the desired ratio."
