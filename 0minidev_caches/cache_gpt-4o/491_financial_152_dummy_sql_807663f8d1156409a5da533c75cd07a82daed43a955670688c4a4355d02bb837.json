"```sql\nSELECT AVG(district.A15) AS average_crimes_1995\nFROM district\nJOIN account ON district.district_id = account.district_id\nWHERE district.A15 > 4000\nAND account.date >= '1997-01-01'\nGROUP BY district.A3;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the average number of crimes committed in 1995 (`A15`) for regions where the number of crimes exceeds 4000 and where there are accounts opened starting from the year 1997. The query joins the `district` and `account` tables using the foreign key relationship between `account.district_id` and `district.district_id`. It filters the results based on the conditions specified and groups the results by region (`A3`)."
