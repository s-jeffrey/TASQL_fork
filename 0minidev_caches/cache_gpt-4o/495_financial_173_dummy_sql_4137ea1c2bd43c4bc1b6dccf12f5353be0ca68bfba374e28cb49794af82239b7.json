"```sql\nSELECT \n    COUNT(*) AS statement_request_count,\n    t.k_symbol AS purpose_of_debit\nFROM \n    trans t\nJOIN \n    account a ON t.account_id = a.account_id\nWHERE \n    a.account_id = 3\n    AND t.k_symbol = 'SLUZBY'\n    AND t.amount = 3539\nGROUP BY \n    t.k_symbol;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts how often account number 3 requests an account statement to be released (indicated by the `k_symbol` value 'SLUZBY') and identifies the purpose of debiting a total of 3539. The query uses the `trans` table to find transactions related to account number 3 and filters by the specified amount and purpose."
