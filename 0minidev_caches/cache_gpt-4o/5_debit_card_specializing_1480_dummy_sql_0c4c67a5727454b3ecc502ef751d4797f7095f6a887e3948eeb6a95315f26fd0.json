"```sql\nSELECT ym.Date\nFROM yearmonth ym\nJOIN customers c ON ym.CustomerID = c.CustomerID\nWHERE c.Segment = 'SME' AND ym.Date BETWEEN '201301' AND '201312'\nORDER BY ym.Consumption DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `yearmonth` table with the `customers` table to filter for SME customers. It then selects the `Date` for the month with the highest consumption in 2013 by ordering the results by `Consumption` in descending order and limiting the output to the top result."
