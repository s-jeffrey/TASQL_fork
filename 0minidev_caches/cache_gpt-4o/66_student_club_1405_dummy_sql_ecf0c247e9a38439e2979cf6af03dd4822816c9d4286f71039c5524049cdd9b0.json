"```sql\nSELECT b.category, SUM(b.amount) AS total_amount_budgeted\nFROM event e\nJOIN budget b ON e.event_id = b.link_to_event\nWHERE e.event_name = 'April Speaker'\nGROUP BY b.category\nORDER BY total_amount_budgeted ASC;\n```\n\nThis SQL query joins the `event` and `budget` tables using the foreign key relationship between `event_id` and `link_to_event`. It filters for the event named 'April Speaker', groups the results by budget category, calculates the total amount budgeted for each category, and orders the results in ascending order based on the total amount budgeted."
