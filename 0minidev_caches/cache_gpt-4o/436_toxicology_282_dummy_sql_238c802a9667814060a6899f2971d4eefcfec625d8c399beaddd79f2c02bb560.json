"```sql\nSELECT \n  (SUM(CASE WHEN a.element = 'h' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(a.element)) AS hydrogen_ratio,\n  m.label\nFROM \n  atom a\nJOIN \n  molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id\nWHERE \n  a.molecule_id = 'TR006'\nGROUP BY \n  m.label;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the ratio of hydrogen elements in the molecule with ID 'TR006' and lists the ratio along with its label, indicating whether the molecule is carcinogenic or not. The query uses a `JOIN` to connect the `atom` and `molecule` tables based on the `molecule_id`, and it applies a `CASE` statement to count hydrogen elements specifically."
