"To answer the question about the number of drivers who finished the race in the 2008 Chinese Grand Prix and have participated in Formula 1 races, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. Identify the race ID for the 2008 Chinese Grand Prix.\n2. Find drivers who have a recorded finish time in the results table for that race, indicating they finished the race.\n3. Count the number of unique drivers who have participated in any race, which can be determined by checking if they have any race entries in the results table.\n\nHere's the SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT r.driverId) AS number_of_drivers\nFROM results r\nJOIN races ra ON r.raceId = ra.raceId\nWHERE ra.year = 2008\n  AND ra.name = 'Chinese Grand Prix'\n  AND r.time IS NOT NULL\n  AND EXISTS (\n    SELECT 1\n    FROM results r2\n    WHERE r2.driverId = r.driverId\n  );\n```\n\nThis query does the following:\n- Joins the `results` table with the `races` table to filter for the 2008 Chinese Grand Prix.\n- Checks that the `time` column in the `results` table is not null, indicating the driver finished the race.\n- Uses a subquery with `EXISTS` to ensure that the driver has participated in at least one race by checking for any entry in the `results` table."
