"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM account\nJOIN loan ON account.account_id = loan.account_id\nWHERE loan.status IN ('C', 'D') AND account.district_id = 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of accounts that have running contracts (status 'C' or 'D') and are located in branch location 1. The query uses a join between the `account` and `loan` tables based on the `account_id` to filter the relevant records."
