"```sql\nSELECT b.bond_type, m.label\nFROM bond b\nJOIN molecule m ON b.molecule_id = m.molecule_id\nWHERE b.molecule_id = 'TR010'\nGROUP BY b.bond_type, m.label\nORDER BY COUNT(b.bond_type) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the bond type that appears most frequently in the bonds associated with molecule TR010 and also retrieves the carcinogenic label of the molecule. The query joins the `bond` and `molecule` tables using the `molecule_id` and groups the results by bond type and molecule label, ordering by the count of each bond type in descending order to find the most common bond type."
