"```sql\nSELECT \n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers WHERE Currency = 'EUR')::float / \n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers WHERE Currency = 'CZK')::float AS eur_to_czk_ratio;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the ratio of customers who pay in EUR to those who pay in CZK by counting the number of customers for each currency and then dividing the two counts. The `::float` is used to ensure that the division results in a floating-point number, which is important for obtaining a precise ratio."
