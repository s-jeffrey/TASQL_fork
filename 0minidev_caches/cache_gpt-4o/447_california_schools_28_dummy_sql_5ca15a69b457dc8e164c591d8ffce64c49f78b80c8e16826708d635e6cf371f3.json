"To answer the question, we need to calculate the average difference between K-12 enrollment and 5-17 enrollment for schools that are locally funded. Then, we need to list the names and DOC type of schools where this difference is above the calculated average. Here's how you can construct the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nWITH EnrollmentDifference AS (\n    SELECT \n        s.School AS SchoolName,\n        s.DOCType,\n        f.`Enrollment (K-12)` - f.`Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` AS EnrollmentDiff\n    FROM \n        frpm f\n    JOIN \n        schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode\n    WHERE \n        f.`Charter Funding Type` = 'Locally funded'\n),\nAverageDifference AS (\n    SELECT \n        AVG(EnrollmentDiff) AS AvgDiff\n    FROM \n        EnrollmentDifference\n)\nSELECT \n    SchoolName,\n    DOCType\nFROM \n    EnrollmentDifference\nWHERE \n    EnrollmentDiff > (SELECT AvgDiff FROM AverageDifference);\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **EnrollmentDifference CTE**: This common table expression calculates the difference between K-12 enrollment and 5-17 enrollment for each school that is locally funded. It also selects the school name and DOC type.\n\n2. **AverageDifference CTE**: This calculates the average of the enrollment differences computed in the `EnrollmentDifference` CTE.\n\n3. **Final SELECT**: This selects the school names and DOC types where the enrollment difference is greater than the average difference calculated in the `AverageDifference` CTE."
