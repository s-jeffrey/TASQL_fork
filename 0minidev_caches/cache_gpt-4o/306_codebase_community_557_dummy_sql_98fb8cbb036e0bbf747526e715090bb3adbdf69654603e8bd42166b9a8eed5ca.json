"```sql\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(p.Id) FILTER (WHERE u.Age > 65) * 100.0 / COUNT(p.Id)) AS elder_user_percentage\nFROM \n    posts p\nJOIN \n    users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id\nWHERE \n    p.Score > 5;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of posts with a score greater than 5 that are owned by users classified as \"elder\" (age greater than 65). It uses a `JOIN` to connect the `posts` and `users` tables based on the `OwnerUserId` and `Id` relationship, and applies a filter to count only those posts owned by elder users."
