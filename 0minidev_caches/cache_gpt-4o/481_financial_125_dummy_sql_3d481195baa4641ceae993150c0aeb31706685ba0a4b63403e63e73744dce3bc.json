"```sql\nSELECT d.A2 AS district_name, \n       ((d.A13 - d.A12) / d.A12) * 100 AS unemployment_rate_increment_percentage\nFROM loan l\nJOIN disp dp ON l.account_id = dp.account_id\nJOIN client c ON dp.client_id = c.client_id\nJOIN district d ON c.district_id = d.district_id\nWHERE l.status = 'D';\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the district name and the percentage increment in unemployment rate from 1995 to 1996 for loans that are still running and where the client is in debt. It uses the relationships defined in the foreign keys to join the necessary tables and applies the formula provided in the evidence to calculate the unemployment rate increment."
