"```sql\nSELECT posts.Id, posts.Title\nFROM posts\nJOIN users ON posts.OwnerUserId = users.Id\nWHERE users.DisplayName = 'Harvey Motulsky'\nORDER BY posts.ViewCount DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the `Id` and `Title` of the post with the most views by the user with the display name \"Harvey Motulsky\". It joins the `posts` table with the `users` table using the `OwnerUserId` foreign key to match the user's display name, then orders the results by `ViewCount` in descending order to get the post with the highest view count, and limits the result to the top entry."
