"```sql\nSELECT ViewCount\nFROM posts\nWHERE Title = 'Integration of Weka and/or RapidMiner into Informatica PowerCenter/Developer';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the `ViewCount` from the `posts` table where the `Title` matches the specified post title. This directly answers the question about how many views the post received."
