"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT district.district_id)\nFROM district\nJOIN client ON district.district_id = client.district_id\nWHERE client.gender = 'F'\nAND district.A11 > 6000\nAND district.A11 < 10000;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct districts where the average salary (A11) is more than 6000 but less than 10000, specifically for female clients. The query joins the `district` and `client` tables using the `district_id` foreign key relationship and filters based on the gender and salary conditions."
