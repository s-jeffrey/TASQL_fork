"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(p.Id) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(Id) FROM posts WHERE YEAR(CreationDate) = 2011)) AS percentage\nFROM \n  posts p\nJOIN \n  users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id\nWHERE \n  YEAR(p.CreationDate) = 2011 AND u.Reputation > 1000;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of posts created in 2011 whose owners had a reputation of over 1000. It uses a join between the `posts` and `users` tables to filter posts based on the owner's reputation. The calculation divides the count of such posts by the total number of posts created in 2011, then multiplies by 100 to get the percentage."
