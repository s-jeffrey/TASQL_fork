"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(CASE WHEN Admission = '+' THEN ID END) - COUNT(CASE WHEN Admission = '-' THEN ID END)) * 100.0 / COUNT(CASE WHEN Admission = '-' THEN ID END) AS deviation_percentage\nFROM \n  Patient\nWHERE \n  SEX = 'M';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the deviation in percentage between the number of male in-patients and male outpatients. It uses conditional aggregation to count the number of male in-patients and outpatients, then computes the percentage deviation based on the counts."
