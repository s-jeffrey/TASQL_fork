"```sql\nSELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN c.hasContentWarning = 0 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS percentage\nFROM cards c\nJOIN legalities l ON c.uuid = l.uuid\nWHERE l.format = 'commander' AND l.status = 'legal';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of cards that are legal in the \"commander\" format and do not have a content warning. It uses a `JOIN` to connect the `cards` and `legalities` tables based on the `uuid` foreign key relationship. The `COUNT` function is used to determine the number of cards without a content warning (`hasContentWarning = 0`) and divides it by the total number of cards that are legal in the \"commander\" format to get the percentage."
