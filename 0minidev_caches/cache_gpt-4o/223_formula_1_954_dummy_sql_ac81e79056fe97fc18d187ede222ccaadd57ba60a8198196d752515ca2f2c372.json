"```sql\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(r.driverId) * 100.0 / COUNT(d.driverId)) AS race_completion_percentage\nFROM \n    results r\nJOIN \n    drivers d ON r.driverId = d.driverId\nJOIN \n    races ra ON r.raceId = ra.raceId\nWHERE \n    d.nationality = 'Japanese' \n    AND ra.year BETWEEN 2007 AND 2009 \n    AND r.time IS NOT NULL;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the race completion percentage for Japanese drivers from 2007 to 2009. It joins the `results`, `drivers`, and `races` tables to filter the data based on the nationality of the drivers and the specified years. The query then calculates the percentage of races completed by counting the number of non-null `time` entries (indicating race completion) and dividing it by the total number of races participated in by Japanese drivers during that period."
