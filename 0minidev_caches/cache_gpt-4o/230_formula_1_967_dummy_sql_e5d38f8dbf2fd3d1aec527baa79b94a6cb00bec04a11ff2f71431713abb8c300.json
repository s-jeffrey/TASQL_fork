"```sql\nSELECT code\nFROM drivers\nORDER BY dob DESC\nLIMIT 3;\n```\n\nTo determine how many of these top 3 youngest drivers are from the Netherlands, you can extend the query as follows:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM (\n  SELECT code, nationality\n  FROM drivers\n  ORDER BY dob DESC\n  LIMIT 3\n) AS top3\nWHERE nationality = 'Dutch';\n```\n\nThis query first selects the codes of the top 3 youngest drivers by ordering the drivers by their date of birth in descending order. Then, it counts how many of these drivers have the nationality 'Dutch', which is equivalent to being from the Netherlands."
