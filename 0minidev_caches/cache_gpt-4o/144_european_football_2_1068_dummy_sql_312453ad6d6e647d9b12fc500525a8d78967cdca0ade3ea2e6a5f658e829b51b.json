"```sql\nSELECT AVG(t2.overall_rating) AS average_overall_rating\nFROM Player_Attributes t2\nJOIN Player t1 ON t2.player_api_id = t1.player_api_id\nWHERE strftime('%Y', t2.date) BETWEEN '2010' AND '2015'\nAND t1.height > 170;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the average overall rating of players who are taller than 170 cm, considering data from the years 2010 to 2015. It joins the `Player_Attributes` table with the `Player` table using the `player_api_id` foreign key relationship and applies the necessary filters on the date and height."
