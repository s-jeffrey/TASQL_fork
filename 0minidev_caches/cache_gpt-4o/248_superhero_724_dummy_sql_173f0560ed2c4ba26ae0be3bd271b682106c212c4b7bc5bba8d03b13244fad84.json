"```sql\nSELECT superhero.superhero_name\nFROM superhero\nJOIN colour AS eye_colour ON superhero.eye_colour_id = eye_colour.id\nJOIN colour AS hair_colour ON superhero.hair_colour_id = hair_colour.id\nWHERE eye_colour.colour = 'Blue'\nAND hair_colour.colour = 'Blond';\n```\nThis SQL query selects the names of superheroes who have blue eyes and blond hair by joining the `superhero` table with the `colour` table twice: once for eye color and once for hair color. It then filters the results to include only those superheroes whose eye color is 'Blue' and hair color is 'Blond'."
