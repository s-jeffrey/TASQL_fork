"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.id)\nFROM sets s\nJOIN set_translations st ON s.code = st.setCode\nWHERE st.language = 'Italian'\n  AND st.translation IS NOT NULL\n  AND s.baseSetSize < 100;\n```\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct sets that have an Italian translation and a base set size of less than 100. It joins the `sets` table with the `set_translations` table using the `setCode` foreign key relationship, and applies the necessary filters based on the evidence provided."
