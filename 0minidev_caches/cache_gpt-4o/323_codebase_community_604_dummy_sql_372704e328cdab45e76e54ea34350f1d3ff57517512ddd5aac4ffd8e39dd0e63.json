"```sql\nSELECT \n    AVG(u.UpVotes) AS AverageUpVotes,\n    AVG(u.Age) AS AverageUserAge\nFROM \n    users u\nJOIN \n    posts p ON u.Id = p.OwnerUserId\nGROUP BY \n    u.Id\nHAVING \n    COUNT(p.Id) > 10;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the average number of up votes and the average age of users who have created more than 10 posts. It joins the `users` and `posts` tables on the `OwnerUserId` and `Id` columns, groups the results by user, and filters to include only those users with more than 10 posts."
