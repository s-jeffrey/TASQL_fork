"```sql\nSELECT CONCAT(d.forename, ' ', d.surname) AS full_name, \n       d.nationality, \n       MAX(ds.points) AS max_points\nFROM driverStandings ds\nJOIN drivers d ON ds.driverId = d.driverId\nGROUP BY ds.driverId\nORDER BY SUM(ds.wins) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the full name, nationality, and maximum points scored by the driver with the most wins. It joins the `driverStandings` table with the `drivers` table using the `driverId` foreign key, groups the results by driver, and orders them by the total number of wins in descending order. The `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the top result (the driver with the most wins) is returned."
