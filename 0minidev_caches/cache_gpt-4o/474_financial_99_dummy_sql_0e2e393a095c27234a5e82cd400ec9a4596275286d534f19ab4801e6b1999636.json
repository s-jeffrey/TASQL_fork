"```sql\nSELECT account.account_id\nFROM account\nJOIN loan ON account.account_id = loan.account_id\nWHERE loan.duration > 12\n  AND loan.amount = (\n    SELECT MAX(amount)\n    FROM loan\n    WHERE duration > 12\n  )\n  AND account.date LIKE '1993%';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the `account_id` from the `account` table for accounts that have a loan duration of more than 12 months, the highest approved loan amount, and an account opening date in 1993. The `LIKE '1993%'` condition ensures that the account opening date is in the year 1993."
