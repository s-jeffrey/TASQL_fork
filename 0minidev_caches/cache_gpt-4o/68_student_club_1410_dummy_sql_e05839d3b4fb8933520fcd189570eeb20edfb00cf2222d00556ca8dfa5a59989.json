"```sql\nSELECT CONCAT(m.first_name, ' ', m.last_name) AS full_name, SUM(e.cost) AS total_cost\nFROM member m\nJOIN expense e ON m.member_id = e.link_to_member\nWHERE m.member_id = 'rec4BLdZHS2Blfp4v'\nGROUP BY m.first_name, m.last_name;\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the full name and total cost of expenses incurred by the member with the specified member ID. It uses a `JOIN` to connect the `member` and `expense` tables based on the foreign key relationship, and it calculates the total cost using the `SUM` function. The `CONCAT` function is used to combine the first and last names into a full name."
