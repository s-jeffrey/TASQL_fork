"```sql\nSELECT AVG(oxygen_atom_count) AS average_oxygen_atoms\nFROM (\n  SELECT m.molecule_id, COUNT(a.atom_id) AS oxygen_atom_count\n  FROM molecule m\n  JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id\n  JOIN bond b ON m.molecule_id = b.molecule_id\n  WHERE a.element = 'o' AND b.bond_type = '-'\n  GROUP BY m.molecule_id\n) AS oxygen_counts;\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the average number of oxygen atoms in molecules that have at least one single bond. It joins the `molecule`, `atom`, and `bond` tables to filter for oxygen atoms and single bonds, then groups by molecule to count the oxygen atoms per molecule, and finally calculates the average of these counts."
