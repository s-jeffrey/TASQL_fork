"```sql\nSELECT c.Text\nFROM posts p\nJOIN comments c ON p.Id = c.PostId\nWHERE p.ViewCount BETWEEN 100 AND 150\nORDER BY c.Score DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the `Text` of the comment with the highest score among posts that have a view count between 100 and 150. It joins the `posts` and `comments` tables using the `PostId` foreign key relationship, filters the posts by the specified view count range, and orders the comments by score in descending order to get the highest score. The `LIMIT 1` ensures that only the top result is returned."
