"To answer the question about the youngest racer's full name, nationality, and the name of the race they first joined, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the youngest racer by finding the maximum date of birth (`dob`) from the `drivers` table.\n2. Retrieve the full name by concatenating the `forename` and `surname`.\n3. Get the nationality of the driver.\n4. Find the first race they participated in by joining the `results` table with the `races` table and ordering by the race date.\n5. Select the name of that race.\n\nHere's the SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT CONCAT(d.forename, ' ', d.surname) AS full_name, \n       d.nationality, \n       r.name AS race_name\nFROM drivers d\nJOIN results res ON d.driverId = res.driverId\nJOIN races r ON res.raceId = r.raceId\nWHERE d.dob = (SELECT MAX(dob) FROM drivers)\nORDER BY r.date ASC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis query:\n- Finds the driver with the latest date of birth.\n- Joins the `results` and `races` tables to find the first race they participated in.\n- Orders the races by date to ensure we get the first race.\n- Limits the result to one record to get the earliest race."
