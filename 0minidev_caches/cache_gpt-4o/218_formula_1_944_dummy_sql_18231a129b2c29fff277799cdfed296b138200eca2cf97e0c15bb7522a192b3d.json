"To answer the question \"How much faster in percentage is the champion than the driver who finished the race last in the 2008 Australian Grand Prix?\", we need to calculate the percentage difference between the champion's time and the last driver's time for that specific race. Here's how you can construct the SQL query:\n\n1. Identify the race ID for the 2008 Australian Grand Prix.\n2. Retrieve the champion's finishing time and the last driver's finishing time.\n3. Calculate the percentage difference.\n\nHere's the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    ((last_driver.milliseconds - champion.milliseconds) / last_driver.milliseconds) * 100 AS percentage_faster\nFROM \n    results AS champion\nJOIN \n    races ON champion.raceId = races.raceId\nJOIN \n    results AS last_driver ON last_driver.raceId = races.raceId\nWHERE \n    races.year = 2008 \n    AND races.name = 'Australian Grand Prix'\n    AND champion.positionOrder = 1\n    AND last_driver.positionOrder = (\n        SELECT MAX(positionOrder) \n        FROM results \n        WHERE raceId = races.raceId\n    )\n    AND champion.milliseconds IS NOT NULL\n    AND last_driver.milliseconds IS NOT NULL;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We join the `results` table twice: once to get the champion's time and once to get the last driver's time.\n- We filter the `races` table to get the race ID for the 2008 Australian Grand Prix.\n- We ensure that both the champion and the last driver have non-null `milliseconds` values, indicating they finished the race.\n- We calculate the percentage difference using the formula: `((last_driver.milliseconds - champion.milliseconds) / last_driver.milliseconds) * 100`."
