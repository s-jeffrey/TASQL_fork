"```sql\nSELECT Patient.Diagnosis\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Laboratory.GPT > 60\nORDER BY Patient.Birthday ASC;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the diagnosis of patients whose ALT glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) levels are beyond the normal range (greater than 60). It orders the results by the patients' date of birth in ascending order, meaning from the oldest to the youngest. The query uses a JOIN operation to connect the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on the `ID` column, which is a foreign key relationship."
