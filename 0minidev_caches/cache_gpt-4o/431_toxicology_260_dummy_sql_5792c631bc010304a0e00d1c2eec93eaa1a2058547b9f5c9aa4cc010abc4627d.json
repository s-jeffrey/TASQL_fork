"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a.atom_id)\nFROM atom a\nJOIN connected c ON a.atom_id = c.atom_id\nJOIN bond b ON c.bond_id = b.bond_id\nWHERE b.bond_type = '#' AND (a.element = 'p' OR a.element = 'br');\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the total number of unique atoms that are part of molecules with triple bonds and contain either phosphorus or bromine. It uses the `atom`, `connected`, and `bond` tables to find the relevant atoms based on the specified conditions."
