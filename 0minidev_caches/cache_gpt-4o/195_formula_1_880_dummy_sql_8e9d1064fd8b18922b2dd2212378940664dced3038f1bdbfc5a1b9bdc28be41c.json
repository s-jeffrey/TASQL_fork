"To answer the question about Paul di Resta's performance in the 853rd race compared to the next race, we need to calculate the percentage difference in his fastest lap speed between these two races. Here's the SQL query that accomplishes this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n  ((r1.fastestLapSpeed - r2.fastestLapSpeed) / r1.fastestLapSpeed) * 100 AS percentage_faster\nFROM \n  results r1\nJOIN \n  drivers d ON r1.driverId = d.driverId\nJOIN \n  results r2 ON r2.driverId = d.driverId\nWHERE \n  d.forename = 'Paul' AND d.surname = 'di Resta'\n  AND r1.raceId = 853\n  AND r2.raceId = 854;\n```\n\nThis query does the following:\n- Joins the `results` table with the `drivers` table to filter results for Paul di Resta.\n- Compares the `fastestLapSpeed` for race 853 and race 854.\n- Calculates the percentage difference in speed between the two races."
