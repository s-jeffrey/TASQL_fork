"```sql\nSELECT AVG(Consumption) AS AverageMonthlyConsumption\nFROM yearmonth\nJOIN customers ON yearmonth.CustomerID = customers.CustomerID\nWHERE customers.Segment = 'SME' AND yearmonth.Date BETWEEN '201301' AND '201312';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the average monthly consumption for customers in the \"SME\" segment for the year 2013. It joins the `yearmonth` table with the `customers` table using the foreign key relationship and filters the results to include only those records where the `Segment` is \"SME\" and the `Date` falls within the year 2013."
