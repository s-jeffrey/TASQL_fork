"```sql\nSELECT Patient.ID, \n       YEAR(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) - YEAR(Patient.Birthday) AS age\nFROM Patient\nJOIN Laboratory ON Patient.ID = Laboratory.ID\nWHERE Laboratory.HCT > 52\nGROUP BY Patient.ID\nHAVING COUNT(Laboratory.ID) >= 2;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the ID and age of patients who have had two or more laboratory examinations where their hematocrit (HCT) level exceeded the normal range of 52. The age is calculated by subtracting the birth year from the current year. The query joins the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables on the `ID` column, filters for HCT levels greater than 52, groups the results by patient ID, and ensures that only patients with two or more such examinations are included."
