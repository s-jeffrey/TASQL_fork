"To answer the question about the percentage of users with 0 upvotes among comments with scores between 5 and 10, we need to join the `comments` and `users` tables based on the foreign key relationship and then perform the necessary calculations. Here's the SQL query that accomplishes this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(DISTINCT c.UserId) FILTER (WHERE u.UpVotes = 0) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT c.UserId)) AS percentage\nFROM \n    comments c\nJOIN \n    users u ON c.UserId = u.Id\nWHERE \n    c.Score BETWEEN 5 AND 10;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **JOIN**: We join the `comments` table with the `users` table using the foreign key `comments.UserId = users.Id`.\n- **WHERE**: We filter the comments to include only those with scores between 5 and 10.\n- **COUNT(DISTINCT c.UserId) FILTER (WHERE u.UpVotes = 0)**: This counts the number of unique users who have 0 upvotes and have made comments with scores between 5 and 10.\n- **COUNT(DISTINCT c.UserId)**: This counts the total number of unique users who have made comments with scores between 5 and 10.\n- **Percentage Calculation**: We calculate the percentage by dividing the count of users with 0 upvotes by the total count of users, and then multiplying by 100.0 to get a percentage."
