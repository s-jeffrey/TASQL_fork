"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE gender.gender = 'Female')::float / COUNT(*) * 100) AS percent_female_heroes\nFROM \n  superhero\nJOIN \n  gender ON superhero.gender_id = gender.id\nJOIN \n  publisher ON superhero.publisher_id = publisher.id\nWHERE \n  publisher.publisher_name = 'Marvel Comics';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of female superheroes published by Marvel Comics. It uses a `JOIN` to connect the `superhero`, `gender`, and `publisher` tables based on their foreign key relationships. The `COUNT(*) FILTER` clause is used to count only the female superheroes, and this count is divided by the total number of superheroes published by Marvel Comics to get the percentage."
