"```sql\nSELECT a1.element AS element_atom1, a2.element AS element_atom2\nFROM bond\nJOIN connected ON bond.bond_id = connected.bond_id\nJOIN atom AS a1 ON connected.atom_id = a1.atom_id\nJOIN atom AS a2 ON connected.atom_id2 = a2.atom_id\nWHERE bond.bond_id = 'TR144_8_19';\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the elements of the two atoms connected by the bond with the ID `TR144_8_19`. It joins the `bond`, `connected`, and `atom` tables to find the relevant atoms and their elements."
