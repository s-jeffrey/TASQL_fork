"```sql\nSELECT s.name\nFROM sets s\nJOIN set_translations st_korean ON s.code = st_korean.setCode\nLEFT JOIN set_translations st_japanese ON s.code = st_japanese.setCode AND st_japanese.language = 'Japanese'\nWHERE st_korean.language = 'Korean' AND st_japanese.language IS NULL;\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the names of sets that have a Korean translation but do not have a Japanese translation. It uses a `JOIN` to find sets with Korean translations and a `LEFT JOIN` to check for the absence of Japanese translations, ensuring that only sets without Japanese translations are included in the result."
