"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(fd.id) * 100.0 / COUNT(c.id)) AS percentage_french_story_spotlight\nFROM \n  cards c\nJOIN \n  foreign_data fd ON c.uuid = fd.uuid\nWHERE \n  c.isStorySpotlight = 1 AND fd.language = 'French';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of cards that are both Story Spotlight cards and have their language set to French. It does this by joining the `cards` table with the `foreign_data` table using the `uuid` foreign key relationship, filtering for Story Spotlight cards and French language, and then computing the percentage."
