"```sql\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(fd.language) * 100.0 / COUNT(c.id)) AS percentage\nFROM \n  cards c\nJOIN \n  foreign_data fd ON c.uuid = fd.uuid\nWHERE \n  (c.power IS NULL OR c.power = '*') AND fd.language = 'French';\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of cards without power that are in French. It joins the `cards` table with the `foreign_data` table using the `uuid` foreign key relationship. The query filters for cards where the `power` is either `NULL` or `*` and the `language` is 'French'. It then calculates the percentage by dividing the count of such cards by the total count of cards without power."
