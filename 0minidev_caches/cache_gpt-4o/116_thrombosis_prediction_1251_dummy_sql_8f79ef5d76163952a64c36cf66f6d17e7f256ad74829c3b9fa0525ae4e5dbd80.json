"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Laboratory.ID)\nFROM Laboratory\nWHERE IGG >= 2000;\n```\n\nThis SQL query counts the number of distinct patients (using their ID) who have an Ig G level higher than the normal range, which is defined as 2000 or more. The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that each patient is only counted once, even if they have multiple laboratory records."
