"```sql\nSELECT e.expense_description\nFROM expense e\nJOIN member m ON e.link_to_member = m.member_id\nWHERE m.first_name = 'Sacha' AND m.last_name = 'Harrison';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the `expense_description` from the `expense` table for expenses incurred by a member with the first name \"Sacha\" and last name \"Harrison\". It uses a join between the `expense` and `member` tables based on the foreign key relationship `expense.link_to_member` referencing `member.member_id`."
