"```sql\nSELECT \n    COUNT(DISTINCT s.City) AS NumberOfCities,\n    COUNT(frpm.School) AS NumberOfSchools\nFROM \n    frpm\nJOIN \n    schools s ON frpm.CDSCode = s.CDSCode\nWHERE \n    s.GSserved = 'K-8' \n    AND s.Magnet = 1 \n    AND frpm.NSLP_Provision_Status = 'Multiple Provision Types'\nGROUP BY \n    s.City;\n``` \n\nThis SQL query selects the number of distinct cities that have schools offering a magnet program serving a grade span of Kindergarten to 8th grade, as well as the total number of such schools in each city. It joins the `frpm` table with the `schools` table on the `CDSCode` primary key and applies the necessary filters based on the evidence provided."
