"To answer the question \"What are the bonds that have phosphorus and nitrogen as their atom elements?\", we need to identify the relevant tables and their relationships based on the provided schema.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant tables**: \n   - We need to look at the `atom` table to find atoms with elements 'p' (phosphorus) and 'n' (nitrogen).\n   - We will then use the `connected` table to find the bonds between these atoms.\n   - Finally, we will reference the `bond` table to get the bond details.\n\n2. **Construct the SQL query**:\n   - We will join the `atom` table to the `connected` table to find pairs of atoms that are connected.\n   - We will filter the results to include only those pairs where one atom is phosphorus and the other is nitrogen.\n   - We will then join the `connected` table to the `bond` table to get the bond details.\n\nHere is the SQL query that accomplishes this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT bond.bond_id\nFROM atom AS a1\nJOIN connected AS c ON a1.atom_id = c.atom_id\nJOIN atom AS a2 ON c.atom_id2 = a2.atom_id\nJOIN bond ON c.bond_id = bond.bond_id\nWHERE a1.element = 'p' AND a2.element = 'n'\n   OR a1.element = 'n' AND a2.element = 'p';\n```\n\n### Explanation of the SQL:\n- We select the `bond_id` from the `bond` table.\n- We join the `atom` table twice (as `a1` and `a2`) to represent the two atoms connected by a bond.\n- We join the `connected` table to find the connections between the atoms.\n- We filter the results to include only those connections where one atom is phosphorus (`'p'`) and the other is nitrogen (`'n'`), allowing for both orders (phosphorus first or nitrogen first).\n\nThis SQL query will return the bonds that connect atoms of phosphorus and nitrogen."
