"To answer the question \"Tally the toxicology element of the 4th atom of each molecule that was carcinogenic,\" we need to construct an SQL query that retrieves the relevant data based on the provided schema and the evidence.\n\nHere's how we can break down the requirements:\n\n1. We need to filter molecules that are carcinogenic, which is indicated by the `label` column in the `molecule` table being equal to '+'.\n2. We need to find the 4th atom of each molecule, which can be identified by checking the `atom_id` column in the `atom` table. The 4th atom can be identified by the substring condition `SUBSTR(atom_id, 7, 1) = '4'`.\n3. We need to retrieve the `element` of the identified atoms.\n\nGiven these points, the SQL query can be constructed as follows:\n\n```sql\nSELECT a.element, COUNT(*) AS tally\nFROM atom a\nJOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id\nWHERE m.label = '+'\nAND SUBSTR(a.atom_id, 7, 1) = '4'\nGROUP BY a.element;\n```\n\n### Explanation of the SQL Query:\n- `SELECT a.element, COUNT(*) AS tally`: This selects the `element` of the atom and counts how many times each element appears.\n- `FROM atom a`: This specifies that we are selecting from the `atom` table and gives it an alias `a`.\n- `JOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id`: This joins the `atom` table with the `molecule` table on the `molecule_id` to filter for carcinogenic molecules.\n- `WHERE m.label = '+'`: This filters the results to only include molecules that are carcinogenic.\n- `AND SUBSTR(a.atom_id, 7, 1) = '4'`: This condition ensures we are only considering the 4th atom of each molecule.\n- `GROUP BY a.element`: This groups the results by the `element` so that we can count occurrences of each element.\n\nThis SQL query will provide the tally of the toxicology elements of the 4th atom for each carcinogenic molecule."
