"To answer the question regarding the increase rate of a client's account balance from a specific date range, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the client whose loan was approved first on the specified date.\n2. Retrieve the account balance for that client on the two specified dates.\n3. Calculate the increase rate based on the retrieved balances.\n\nHere\u2019s how the SQL query can be structured:\n\n```sql\nWITH FirstLoan AS (\n    SELECT c.client_id, l.account_id\n    FROM client c\n    JOIN loan l ON c.client_id = l.client_id\n    WHERE l.date = (SELECT MIN(date) FROM loan WHERE date >= '1993-07-05')\n    LIMIT 1\n),\nBalances AS (\n    SELECT t.account_id,\n           MAX(CASE WHEN t.date = '1993-03-22' THEN t.balance END) AS balance_A,\n           MAX(CASE WHEN t.date = '1998-12-27' THEN t.balance END) AS balance_B\n    FROM trans t\n    JOIN FirstLoan fl ON t.account_id = fl.account_id\n    WHERE t.date IN ('1993-03-22', '1998-12-27')\n    GROUP BY t.account_id\n)\nSELECT ((balance_B - balance_A) / balance_A) * 100 AS increase_rate\nFROM Balances\nWHERE balance_A IS NOT NULL AND balance_B IS NOT NULL;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **FirstLoan CTE**: This Common Table Expression (CTE) retrieves the `client_id` and `account_id` of the client whose loan was approved first on or after July 5, 1993.\n- **Balances CTE**: This CTE retrieves the account balance for the specified dates (March 22, 1993, and December 27, 1998) for the identified client.\n- **Final SELECT**: This calculates the increase rate of the account balance using the formula provided in the evidence.\n\nThis SQL query will return the increase rate of the account balance for the specified client and dates."
