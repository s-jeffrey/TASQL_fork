"```sql\nSELECT \n    c.CustomerID, \n    SUM(t.Price * t.Amount) AS TotalSpent, \n    AVG(t.Price) AS AveragePricePerItem, \n    c.Currency\nFROM \n    transactions_1k t\nJOIN \n    customers c ON t.CustomerID = c.CustomerID\nGROUP BY \n    c.CustomerID, c.Currency\nORDER BY \n    TotalSpent DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n``` \n\nThis SQL query selects the top spending customer by calculating the total amount spent and the average price per item purchased, while also retrieving the currency used by that customer. It joins the `transactions_1k` table with the `customers` table based on the `CustomerID` foreign key relationship, groups the results by customer and currency, and orders the results to find the customer with the highest total spending."
