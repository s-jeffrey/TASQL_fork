"To answer the question \"How much faster in percentage is the champion than the driver who finished the race last in the 2008 Australian Grand Prix?\", we need to gather the finishing times of both the champion and the last driver from the results table for the specified race. \n\nHere's how we can construct the SQL query:\n\n1. Identify the raceId for the 2008 Australian Grand Prix.\n2. Retrieve the finishing time of the champion and the last driver from the results table.\n3. Calculate the percentage difference in their finishing times.\n\nThe SQL query will look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    (CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(r1.time, ':', -1) AS DECIMAL) + \n     CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(r1.time, ':', 1), ':', -1) AS DECIMAL) * 60 + \n     CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(r1.time, ':', 1) AS DECIMAL) * 3600) AS champion_time,\n    \n    (CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(r2.time, ':', -1) AS DECIMAL) + \n     CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(r2.time, ':', 1), ':', -1) AS DECIMAL) * 60 + \n     CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(r2.time, ':', 1) AS DECIMAL) * 3600) AS last_driver_time,\n    \n    ((CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(r2.time, ':', -1) AS DECIMAL) + \n      CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(r2.time, ':', 1), ':', -1) AS DECIMAL) * 60 + \n      CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(r2.time, ':', 1) AS DECIMAL) * 3600) - \n     (CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(r1.time, ':', -1) AS DECIMAL) + \n      CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(r1.time, ':', 1), ':', -1) AS DECIMAL) * 60 + \n      CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(r1.time, ':', 1) AS DECIMAL) * 3600)) / \n     (CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(r2.time, ':', -1) AS DECIMAL) + \n      CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(r2.time, ':', 1), ':', -1) AS DECIMAL) * 60 + \n      CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(r2.time, ':', 1) AS DECIMAL) * 3600)) * 100 AS percentage_difference\n\nFROM \n    results r1\nJOIN \n    results r2 ON r1.raceId = r2.raceId\nWHERE \n    r1.position = 1 AND r2.position = (SELECT MAX(position) FROM results WHERE raceId = r1.raceId)\n    AND r1.raceId = (SELECT raceId FROM races WHERE name = 'Australian Grand Prix' AND year = 2008);\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We are selecting the finishing times of the champion (position 1) and the last driver (maximum position) for the 2008 Australian Grand Prix.\n- We convert the finishing times from the format `HH:MM:SS.mmm` to total seconds for easier calculation.\n- We calculate the percentage difference using the formula provided in the evidence.\n- The `JOIN` ensures we are comparing results from the same race. \n\nThis SQL query will return the percentage difference in finishing times between the champion and the last driver for the specified race."
