"To answer the question, we need to extract the abbreviated code of the driver who had a Q3 time of 0:01:33 in race number 45. \n\nBased on the provided schema, we can see that the relevant tables are `qualifying` (to get the Q3 time and driver ID) and `drivers` (to get the driver's abbreviated code). \n\nThe SQL query will involve joining these two tables based on the `driverId` and filtering for the specific race ID and Q3 time.\n\nHere is the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT d.code\nFROM qualifying q\nJOIN drivers d ON q.driverId = d.driverId\nWHERE q.raceId = 45 AND q.q3 = '0:01:33';\n```\n\nThis query selects the `code` from the `drivers` table where the `driverId` matches the one in the `qualifying` table for race ID 45 and where the Q3 time is exactly 0:01:33."
