"To answer the question \"What elements are in a double type bond?\", we need to identify the atoms involved in double bonds and then retrieve their corresponding elements. \n\nGiven the evidence that a double type bond refers to `bond_type = '='`, we can construct the SQL query as follows:\n\n```sql\nSELECT a.element\nFROM bond b\nJOIN connected c ON b.bond_id = c.bond_id\nJOIN atom a ON c.atom_id = a.atom_id OR c.atom_id2 = a.atom_id\nWHERE b.bond_type = '=';\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **SELECT a.element**: We are selecting the `element` from the `atom` table.\n2. **FROM bond b**: We start from the `bond` table, aliased as `b`.\n3. **JOIN connected c ON b.bond_id = c.bond_id**: We join the `connected` table to get the connections (atoms) for each bond.\n4. **JOIN atom a ON c.atom_id = a.atom_id OR c.atom_id2 = a.atom_id**: We join the `atom` table to get the elements of the atoms involved in the bond. We check both `atom_id` and `atom_id2` to ensure we get elements for both atoms connected by the bond.\n5. **WHERE b.bond_type = '='**: We filter the results to only include double bonds.\n\nThis SQL query will return the elements of the atoms that are part of double type bonds."
