"```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a.atom_id) \nFROM atom a \nJOIN connected c ON a.atom_id = c.atom_id OR a.atom_id = c.atom_id2 \nJOIN bond b ON c.bond_id = b.bond_id \nWHERE b.bond_type = '-' \nAND (a.element = 'p' OR a.element = 'br');\n``` \n\nThis SQL query counts the distinct atoms that are part of triple-bonded molecules (indicated by `bond_type = '-'`) and have the element phosphorus (`'p'`) or bromine (`'br'`). The joins ensure that we are correctly linking atoms to their bonds and connections."
