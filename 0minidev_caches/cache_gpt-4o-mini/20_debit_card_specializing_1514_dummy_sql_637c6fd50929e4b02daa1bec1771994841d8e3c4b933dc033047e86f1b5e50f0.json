"To answer the question \"What kind of currency did the customer pay at 16:25:00 in 2012/8/24?\", we need to extract the relevant information from the database schema. The question specifically asks for the currency used in a transaction that occurred at a specific time and date.\n\nBased on the provided schema, we can see that the `transactions_1k` table contains the `Time`, `Date`, and `CustomerID` columns, while the `customers` table contains the `Currency` column. We will need to join these two tables on the `CustomerID` to get the currency information.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can construct the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT c.Currency\nFROM transactions_1k t\nJOIN customers c ON t.CustomerID = c.CustomerID\nWHERE t.Time = '16:25:00' AND t.Date = '2012-08-24';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the `Currency` from the `customers` table, joining it with the `transactions_1k` table on the `CustomerID`. It filters the results to only include the transaction that occurred at `16:25:00` on `2012-08-24`."
