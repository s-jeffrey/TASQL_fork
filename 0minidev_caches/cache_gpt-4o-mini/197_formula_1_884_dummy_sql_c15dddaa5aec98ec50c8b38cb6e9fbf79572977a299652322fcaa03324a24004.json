"To answer the question \"List the names of all races that occurred in the earliest recorded year and month,\" we need to find the minimum date from the `races` table, extract the year and month from that date, and then select the names of the races that occurred in that year and month.\n\nHere is the SQL query that accomplishes this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT name \nFROM races \nWHERE YEAR(date) = (SELECT MIN(YEAR(date)) FROM races) \nAND MONTH(date) = (SELECT MIN(MONTH(date)) FROM races WHERE YEAR(date) = (SELECT MIN(YEAR(date)) FROM races));\n```\n\nThis query does the following:\n1. It selects the `name` of the races from the `races` table.\n2. It filters the results to only include races that occurred in the earliest recorded year and month by using subqueries to find the minimum year and month from the `date` column in the `races` table."
