"```sql\nSELECT bond_type, COUNT(bond_type) AS bond_count\nFROM bond\nJOIN molecule ON bond.molecule_id = molecule.molecule_id\nWHERE molecule.molecule_id = 'TR010'\nGROUP BY bond_type\nORDER BY bond_count DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n``` \n\nThis SQL query selects the bond type that has the highest count of occurrences for the specified molecule (TR010) and groups the results by bond type. It also ensures that only the relevant information is retrieved, as per the question's requirements."
