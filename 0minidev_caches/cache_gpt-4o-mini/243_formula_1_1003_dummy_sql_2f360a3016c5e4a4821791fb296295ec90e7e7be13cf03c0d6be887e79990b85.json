"To answer the question \"How many accidents did the driver who had the highest number of accidents in the Canadian Grand Prix have?\", we need to construct an SQL query that retrieves the required information based on the provided schema and evidence.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant tables**: \n   - We need to look at the `results` table to find the driver IDs and their corresponding accident counts.\n   - The `status` table will help us filter for accidents (assuming statusId = 3 indicates an accident).\n   - The `races` table will help us identify the Canadian Grand Prix.\n\n2. **Join the tables**: \n   - We will join the `results` table with the `races` table to filter for the Canadian Grand Prix.\n   - We will also join the `results` table with the `status` table to count the number of accidents.\n\n3. **Count accidents**: \n   - We will group by driver and count the number of accidents for each driver.\n\n4. **Select the driver with the highest number of accidents**: \n   - Finally, we will order the results to get the driver with the maximum accidents.\n\nHere is the SQL query that accomplishes this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(r.statusId) AS accident_count\nFROM results r\nJOIN races ra ON r.raceId = ra.raceId\nJOIN status s ON r.statusId = s.statusId\nWHERE ra.name = 'Canadian Grand Prix' AND s.statusId = 3\nGROUP BY r.driverId\nORDER BY accident_count DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\n### Explanation of the SQL:\n- `SELECT COUNT(r.statusId) AS accident_count`: This counts the number of accidents for each driver.\n- `FROM results r`: We are querying from the `results` table.\n- `JOIN races ra ON r.raceId = ra.raceId`: This joins the `results` table with the `races` table to filter for the Canadian Grand Prix.\n- `JOIN status s ON r.statusId = s.statusId`: This joins the `results` table with the `status` table to filter for accidents.\n- `WHERE ra.name = 'Canadian Grand Prix' AND s.statusId = 3`: This filters the results to only include those from the Canadian Grand Prix where the status indicates an accident.\n- `GROUP BY r.driverId`: This groups the results by driver ID to count accidents per driver.\n- `ORDER BY accident_count DESC`: This orders the results by the number of accidents in descending order.\n- `LIMIT 1`: This limits the results to only the driver with the highest number of accidents. \n\nThis query will return the number of accidents for the driver with the highest number of accidents in the Canadian Grand Prix."
