"```sql\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT c.CustomerID) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT t.CustomerID)) AS percentage\nFROM customers c\nINNER JOIN transactions_1k t ON c.CustomerID = t.CustomerID\nWHERE t.Date = '2012-08-25' AND c.Currency = 'EUR'\n```\n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of customers who used EUR on the date 2012-08-25. It joins the `customers` table with the `transactions_1k` table on the `CustomerID` field. The `WHERE` clause filters the transactions to include only those that occurred on '2012-08-25' and where the customer's currency is 'EUR'. The `COUNT(DISTINCT c.CustomerID)` counts the unique customers who meet these criteria, and `COUNT(DISTINCT t.CustomerID)` counts all unique customers who made transactions on that date. The result is multiplied by 100.0 to convert it into a percentage."
