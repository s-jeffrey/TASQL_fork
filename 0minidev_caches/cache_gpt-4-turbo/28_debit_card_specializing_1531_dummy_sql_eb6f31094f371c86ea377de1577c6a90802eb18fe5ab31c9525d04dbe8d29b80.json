"To answer the question \"Who is the top spending customer and how much is the average price per single item purchased by this customer? What currency was being used?\", we need to calculate the total spending per customer, find the top spender, and then calculate the average price per single item purchased by this customer. We also need to retrieve the currency used by this customer.\n\nHere's the SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    t.CustomerID,\n    c.Currency,\n    SUM(t.Price * t.Amount) AS TotalSpending,\n    SUM(t.Price) / SUM(t.Amount) AS AvgPricePerItem\nFROM \n    transactions_1k t\nJOIN \n    customers c ON t.CustomerID = c.CustomerID\nGROUP BY \n    t.CustomerID, c.Currency\nORDER BY \n    TotalSpending DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **JOIN**: We join the `transactions_1k` table with the `customers` table on `CustomerID` to access the currency information.\n2. **GROUP BY**: We group the results by `CustomerID` and `Currency` to calculate the total spending and average price per item for each customer.\n3. **SUM(t.Price * t.Amount)**: This calculates the total spending by each customer.\n4. **SUM(t.Price) / SUM(t.Amount)**: This calculates the average price per single item purchased by each customer, based on the provided evidence formula.\n5. **ORDER BY TotalSpending DESC**: This orders the results by total spending in descending order.\n6. **LIMIT 1**: This limits the results to the top spending customer.\n\nThis query will provide the top spending customer, the average price per single item they purchased, and the currency they used."
