"To answer the question, we need to find the age of the patient who had the highest hemoglobin count at the time of the examination and also retrieve the doctor's diagnosis for that patient. \n\nGiven the evidence provided, we will use the `Examination` and `Patient` tables, and we will need to join them based on the foreign key relationship. The SQL query will calculate the age by subtracting the year of the patient's birthday from the year of the examination date, and it will also select the diagnosis.\n\nHere is the SQL query that accomplishes this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    SUBTRACT(YEAR(e.Examination_Date), YEAR(p.Birthday)) AS Age,\n    p.Diagnosis\nFROM \n    Examination e\nJOIN \n    Patient p ON e.ID = p.ID\nWHERE \n    e.HGB = (SELECT MAX(HGB) FROM Examination)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We select the age of the patient by subtracting the year of the `Birthday` from the year of the `Examination Date`.\n- We also select the `Diagnosis` from the `Patient` table.\n- We join the `Examination` table (`e`) with the `Patient` table (`p`) on the `ID` field.\n- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include the patient with the highest hemoglobin count (`HGB`). \n\nThis query will return the age of the patient with the highest hemoglobin count and their diagnosis."
