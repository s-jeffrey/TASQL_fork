"To answer the question \"How many connections does the atom 19 have?\", we need to count the number of entries in the `connected` table where `atom_id` or `atom_id2` corresponds to an atom with an id that ends with `_19`. \n\nGiven the evidence, we can construct the SQL query as follows:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM connected \nWHERE atom_id LIKE 'TR%_19' OR atom_id2 LIKE 'TR%_19';\n```\n\nThis SQL statement counts all the connections for the atom with id ending in `_19` by checking both `atom_id` and `atom_id2` in the `connected` table."
