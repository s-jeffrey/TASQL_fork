"To answer the question \"On what year did the youngest driver had his first qualifying race? Also state the name, date and time of the race,\" we need to find the youngest driver based on their date of birth, then find their first qualifying race, and finally retrieve the relevant details about that race.\n\nHere's how we can construct the SQL query:\n\n1. **Identify the youngest driver**: We will select the driver with the maximum date of birth (which means they are the youngest).\n2. **Find the first qualifying race for that driver**: We will join the qualifying table with the races table to get the details of the race.\n3. **Select the required fields**: We will select the year of the race, the name of the race, the date, and the time.\n\nHere is the SQL query that accomplishes this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    YEAR(races.date) AS race_year, \n    races.name AS race_name, \n    races.date AS race_date, \n    races.time AS race_time\nFROM \n    drivers\nJOIN \n    qualifying ON drivers.driverId = qualifying.driverId\nJOIN \n    races ON qualifying.raceId = races.raceId\nWHERE \n    drivers.dob = (SELECT MAX(dob) FROM drivers)\nORDER BY \n    races.date\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\n### Explanation of the SQL:\n- We select the year, name, date, and time of the race.\n- We join the `drivers`, `qualifying`, and `races` tables to link the driver to their qualifying races.\n- We filter to find the youngest driver by using a subquery that selects the maximum date of birth from the `drivers` table.\n- We order the results by the race date to get the first qualifying race.\n- We limit the results to 1 to get only the first qualifying race for the youngest driver."
