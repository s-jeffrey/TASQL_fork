"```sql\nSELECT \n    (COUNT(a.atom_id) * 100.0 / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT b.bond_id), 0)) AS percent\nFROM \n    atom a\nJOIN \n    bond b ON a.molecule_id = b.molecule_id\nWHERE \n    a.element = 'cl' AND b.bond_type = '-'\nGROUP BY \n    b.molecule_id;\n``` \n\nThis SQL query calculates the percentage of atoms that are chlorine (element = 'cl') among single bond molecules (bond_type = '-') by counting the number of chlorine atoms and dividing it by the total number of distinct bonds in the same molecule. The `NULLIF` function is used to avoid division by zero."
