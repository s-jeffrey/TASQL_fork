"To answer the question \"How old is the youngest Japanese driver? What is his name?\", we need to select the name and calculate the age of the youngest driver from the `drivers` table where the nationality is 'Japanese'. \n\nThe SQL query will involve filtering the drivers based on nationality, calculating their age from the date of birth, and then selecting the youngest one. Here's how the SQL query would look:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    forename, \n    surname, \n    (YEAR(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) - YEAR(dob)) AS age \nFROM \n    drivers \nWHERE \n    nationality = 'Japanese' \nORDER BY \n    dob DESC \nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **SELECT forename, surname**: We are selecting the first name and surname of the driver.\n- **(YEAR(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) - YEAR(dob)) AS age**: This calculates the age of the driver based on the current year and their date of birth.\n- **FROM drivers**: We are querying the `drivers` table.\n- **WHERE nationality = 'Japanese'**: This filters the results to only include drivers from Japan.\n- **ORDER BY dob DESC**: This orders the results by date of birth in descending order, so the youngest driver comes first.\n- **LIMIT 1**: This limits the results to only the youngest driver. \n\nThis SQL query will return the name and age of the youngest Japanese driver."
