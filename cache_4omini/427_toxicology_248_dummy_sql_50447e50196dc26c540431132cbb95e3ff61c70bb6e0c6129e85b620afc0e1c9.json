"To answer the question \"What are the atoms of the triple bond with the molecule 'TR041'?\", we need to identify the relevant tables and their relationships based on the provided schema and the evidence.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant tables**: \n   - We need to look at the `bond` table to find the triple bond associated with the molecule `TR041`.\n   - Then, we will use the `connected` table to find the atoms associated with that bond.\n\n2. **Determine the bond type**: \n   - The question specifies a triple bond, which corresponds to `bond_type = ''` (as per the evidence provided).\n\n3. **Construct the SQL query**:\n   - We will first select the `bond_id` from the `bond` table where `molecule_id` is `TR041` and `bond_type` is `''`.\n   - Then, we will use that `bond_id` to find the corresponding atoms in the `connected` table.\n\nHere is the SQL query that accomplishes this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT c.atom_id, c.atom_id2\nFROM bond b\nJOIN connected c ON b.bond_id = c.bond_id\nWHERE b.molecule_id = 'TR041' AND b.bond_type = '';\n```\n\nThis SQL query selects the `atom_id` and `atom_id2` from the `connected` table, joining it with the `bond` table to filter for the specific molecule and bond type."
