"To answer the question \"What is the percentage of carbon in double-bond molecules?\", we need to construct an SQL query that calculates the percentage of carbon atoms in molecules that contain double bonds. \n\nBased on the provided evidence, we can derive the SQL query as follows:\n\n1. We need to join the relevant tables: `atom`, `bond`, and `connected`.\n2. We will filter for double-bond molecules using the `bond_type` column in the `bond` table.\n3. We will count the number of carbon atoms (where `element = 'c'`) and divide that by the total number of atoms in double-bond molecules.\n\nHere is the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    (SUM(CASE WHEN a.element = 'c' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(a.atom_id)) AS carbon_percentage\nFROM \n    atom a\nJOIN \n    connected c ON a.atom_id = c.atom_id OR a.atom_id = c.atom_id2\nJOIN \n    bond b ON c.bond_id = b.bond_id\nWHERE \n    b.bond_type = '='\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We select the percentage of carbon atoms by summing up the instances where the element is 'c' and dividing it by the total count of atoms.\n- We join the `atom` table with the `connected` table to get the relationships between atoms and bonds.\n- We then join the `connected` table with the `bond` table to filter for double bonds (`bond_type = '='`).\n- The multiplication by `100.0` is to convert the fraction into a percentage. \n\nThis query will give us the desired percentage of carbon in double-bond molecules."
