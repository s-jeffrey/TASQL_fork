"To answer the question \"How many Japanese constructors have 0 points in 2 races?\", we need to construct an SQL query that counts the number of constructors with the specified conditions. \n\nHere's how we can break down the requirements:\n\n1. We need to filter constructors based on their nationality being 'Japanese'.\n2. We need to join the constructors table with the results table to check the points scored in races.\n3. We need to group the results by constructor and count the number of races where they scored 0 points.\n4. Finally, we need to filter the grouped results to only include those constructors who have 0 points in exactly 2 races.\n\nHere is the SQL query that accomplishes this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.constructorId) AS JapaneseConstructorsWithZeroPoints\nFROM constructors c\nJOIN results r ON c.constructorId = r.constructorId\nWHERE c.nationality = 'Japanese' \nAND r.points = 0\nGROUP BY c.constructorId\nHAVING COUNT(r.raceId) = 2;\n```\n\n### Explanation of the SQL Query:\n- `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.constructorId)`: This counts the distinct constructor IDs that meet the criteria.\n- `FROM constructors c`: We are selecting from the constructors table.\n- `JOIN results r ON c.constructorId = r.constructorId`: We join the results table to get the points for each constructor.\n- `WHERE c.nationality = 'Japanese' AND r.points = 0`: We filter for Japanese constructors who have scored 0 points.\n- `GROUP BY c.constructorId`: We group the results by constructor ID to aggregate the points.\n- `HAVING COUNT(r.raceId) = 2`: We only want those constructors who have 0 points in exactly 2 races.\n\nThis query will return the count of Japanese constructors who have 0 points in 2 races."
