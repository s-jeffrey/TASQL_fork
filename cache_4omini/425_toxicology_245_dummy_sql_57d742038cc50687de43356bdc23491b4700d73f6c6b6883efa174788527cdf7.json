"To answer the question \"What is the average number of bonds the atoms with the element iodine have?\", we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the atoms with the element iodine (element = 'i').\n2. Count the number of bonds associated with these atoms.\n3. Calculate the average number of bonds per iodine atom.\n\nGiven the schema and the relationships, we can construct the SQL query as follows:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(bond_count) AS average_bonds\nFROM (\n    SELECT COUNT(c.bond_id) AS bond_count\n    FROM atom a\n    LEFT JOIN connected c ON a.atom_id = c.atom_id OR a.atom_id = c.atom_id2\n    WHERE a.element = 'i'\n    GROUP BY a.atom_id\n) AS bond_counts;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We first select from the `atom` table where the `element` is 'i' (iodine).\n- We join the `connected` table to count the number of bonds for each iodine atom. The `LEFT JOIN` is used to ensure we count all bonds, even if an atom has no bonds.\n- We group by `atom_id` to get the count of bonds for each individual iodine atom.\n- Finally, we calculate the average of these counts using `AVG()`.\n\nThis SQL query will return the average number of bonds for atoms with the element iodine."
