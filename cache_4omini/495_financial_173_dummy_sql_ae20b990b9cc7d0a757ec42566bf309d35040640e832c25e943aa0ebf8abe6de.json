"To answer the question, we need to extract two pieces of information: the frequency of account statements requested by account number 3 and the purpose of the debit transaction of 3539.\n\n1. **Frequency of account statements for account number 3**: This information is stored in the `account` table under the `frequency` column.\n2. **Aim of debiting 3539**: This information can be found in the `order` or `trans` table, specifically in the `k_symbol` column, which describes the purpose of the transaction.\n\nGiven this, we can construct the SQL query as follows:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    (SELECT frequency FROM account WHERE account_id = 3) AS account_statement_frequency,\n    (SELECT k_symbol FROM trans WHERE amount = 3539) AS debit_purpose\n```\n\nThis SQL query retrieves the frequency of account statements for account number 3 and the purpose of the debit transaction of 3539."
